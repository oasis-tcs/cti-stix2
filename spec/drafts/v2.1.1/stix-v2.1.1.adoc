== Introduction

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).
STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.
STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.

The objects and features added for inclusion in STIX 2.1 represent an iterative approach to fulfilling basic consumer and producer requirements for CTI sharing.
Objects and properties not included in this version of STIX, but deemed necessary by the community, will be included in future releases.

=== Document Conventions

The following color, font and font style conventions are used in this document:

* The [stixfont]#Consolas# font is used for all type names, property names and literals.
** type names are in red with a light red background – [stixtype]#threat-actor#
** property names are in bold style – *created_at*
** literals (values) are in blue with a blue background – [stixliteral]#malicious-activity#
** All relationship types are string literals; therefore, they will also appear in blue with a blue background – [stixrelationship]#related-to#
* In an object's property table, if a common property is being redefined in some way, then the background is dark grey.
* All examples in this document are expressed in JSON.
They are in `mono` font, with straight quotes, black text and a light grey background, and using 2-space indentation.
JSON examples in this document are representations of JSON objects <<RFC8259>>.
They should not be interpreted as string literals.
The ordering of object keys is insignificant.
Whitespace before or after JSON structural characters in the examples are insignificant <<RFC8259>>.
* Parts of the example may be omitted for conciseness and clarity. These omitted parts are denoted with the ellipses (...).
* The term "hyphen" is used throughout this document to refer to the ASCII hyphen or minus character, which in Unicode is "hyphen-minus", U+002D.

=== Overview

STIX is a schema that defines a taxonomy of cyber threat intelligence that is represented by the following objects:

[width="99%",cols="16%,14%,14%,14%,14%,14%,14%",]
|===
6+|*STIX Objects*  .3+|STIX Bundle Object
3+|*STIX Core Objects* 3+|*STIX Meta Objects (SMO)* 
|STIX Domain Objects (SDO) |STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCO) |STIX Relationship Objects (SRO) |Extension Definition Objects |Language Content Objects |Marking Definition Objects
|===

*STIX Core Objects*

Any SDO, SCO, or SRO.


*STIX Domain Objects*

Higher Level Intelligence Objects that represent behaviors and constructs that threat analysts would typically create or work with while understanding the threat landscape.


*STIX Cyber-observable Objects*

Objects that represent observed facts about a network or host that may be used and related to higher level intelligence to form a more complete understanding of the threat landscape.


*STIX Relationship Objects*

Objects that connect STIX Domain Objects together, STIX Cyber-observable Objects together, and connect STIX Domain Objects and STIX Cyber-observable Objects together to form a more complete understanding of the threat landscape.


*STIX Meta Objects (SMO)*

A STIX Object that provides the necessary glue and associated metadata to enrich or extend STIX Core Objects to support user and system workflows.


*STIX Bundle Object*

An object that provides a wrapper mechanism for packaging arbitrary STIX content together.


==== Graph-Based Model

STIX is a connected graph of nodes and edges.
STIX Domain Objects and STIX Cyber-observable Objects define the graph nodes and STIX relationships (including both external STIX Relationship Objects and embedded relationships) define the edges.
This graph-based language conforms to common analysis approaches and allows for flexible, modular, structured, and consistent representations of CTI.

==== STIX Domain Objects

STIX defines a set of STIX Domain Objects (SDOs): Attack Pattern, Campaign, Course of Action, Grouping, Identity, Indicator, Infrastructure, Intrusion Set, Location, Malware, Malware Analysis, Note, Observed Data, Opinion, Report, Threat Actor, Tool, and Vulnerability.
Each of these objects corresponds to a concept commonly used in CTI.

STIX Domain Objects are defined in <<_stix_domain_objects_2>>.

==== STIX Cyber-observable Objects

STIX defines a set of STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) for characterizing host-based and network-based information.
SCOs are used by various STIX Domain Objects (SDOs) to provide supporting context.
The Observed Data SDO, for example, indicates that the raw data was observed at a particular time.

STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) document the facts concerning what happened on a network or host, and do not capture the who, when, or why.
By associating SCOs with STIX Domain Objects (SDOs), it is possible to convey a higher-level understanding of the threat landscape, and to potentially provide insight as to the who and the why particular intelligence may be relevant to an organization.
For example, information about a file that existed, a process that was observed running, or that network traffic occurred between two IPs can all be captured as SCOs.

STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) are defined in <<_stix_cyber_observable_objects_2>>.

Previously, in STIX 2.0, Cyber-observable Objects could only exist as objects within an Observed Data object. It is still possible to represent Cyber-observable Objects in this way, but this method has been deprecated. See <<_observable_container_deprecated>>.

==== STIX Relationships

A relationship is a link between STIX Domain Objects (SDOs), STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs), or between an SDO and a SCO that describes the way in which the objects are related.
Relationships can be represented using an external STIX Relationship Object (SRO) or, in some cases, through certain properties which store an identifier reference that comprises an embedded relationship, (for example the *created_by_ref* property).

The generic STIX Relationship Object (SRO) is one of two SROs and is used for most relationships in STIX.
This generic SRO contains a property called *relationship_type* to describe more specifically what the relationship represents.
This specification defines a set of known terms to use for the *relationship_type* property between SDOs of specific types.
For example, the Indicator SDO defines a relationship from itself to Malware via a *relationship_type* of [stixliteral]#indicates# to describe how the Indicator can be used to detect the presence of the corresponding Malware. In addition to the terms defined in the specification, STIX also allows for user-defined terms to be used as the relationship type.

Currently the only other SRO (besides a generic Relationship) is the Sighting SRO.
The Sighting object is used to capture cases where an entity has "seen" an SDO, such as sighting an indicator.
Sighting is a separate SRO because it contains additional properties such as *count* that are only applicable to Sighting relationships.
Other SROs may be defined in future versions of STIX if new relationships are identified that also require additional properties not present on the generic Relationship object.

In addition to relationships created using the SROs (Relationship and Sighting), STIX also uses ID references to represent embedded relationships.
Embedded relationships are simply ID reference properties on STIX Objects that contain the ID of a different STIX Object.
Embedded relationships are used when the property is an inherent part of the object and not something that a third party might add or something that might require the inclusion of a confidence score.
Because they represent an inherent linkage and have no other properties, an SRO is not needed to represent them.
An embedded relationship can only be asserted by the creator of the object ("object creator") it is contained in.

For example, the entity that created a STIX Object is an inherent, factual part of that object and therefore that information is captured in an embedded relationship contained in the *created_by_ref* property rather than through the use of an SRO.

Embedded relationships (ID references) are described in section <<_object_ids_and_references>> and STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) are defined in <<_stix_relationship_objects>>.

==== STIX Cyber Observable Observed Data Relationships (Deprecated)

While refining STIX for the 2.1 specification, the CTI TC reached consensus that the STIX 2.0 Cyber Observable Container (see <<_observable_container_deprecated>>) and the Observed Data object's graph within a graph model was insufficient to support critical CTI use cases.
Consequently, in STIX 2.1, the Cyber Observable Container is deprecated, and implementers are encouraged to use STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) instead.
Within the context of the (deprecated) Cyber Observable Container's graph within a graph model, an object relationship is a reference linking two (or more) related SCOs and these relationships are constrained to SCOs contained within the same Cyber Observable Container.

A Cyber Observable Container relationship should not be confused with STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) that are defined in <<_stix_relationship_objects>>.

==== STIX Patterning

The STIX Patterning language enables the detection of activity on networks and endpoints.
This language allows matching against time stamped cyber observable data collected by a threat intelligence platform or other similar system.
STIX Patterning is currently only used by the STIX Indicator object, but it can be employed in other use cases.

Before undertaking work on STIX Patterning, a thorough effort to evaluate existing patterning languages (e.g., Snort or Yara) was performed.
This effort identified that no existing patterning language solves or supports the STIX use cases. Extending other languages was ruled out as unfeasible, both from a technical perspective as well as taking into consideration that from a licensing/IPR perspective, extending an existing language under the auspices of OASIS would have been problematic.

STIX Patterning was primarily designed to support STIX Indicators.
As such it is a mechanism for communicating how to find malicious code and/or threat actors active within a given network or endpoint.

This language release is focused on supporting a common set of use cases and therefore allows for the expression of an initial set of patterns that producers and consumers of STIX can utilize.
As more complex patterns are deemed necessary, the STIX patterning language will be extended in future releases to improve its effectiveness as an automated detection/remediation method.

STIX Patterning is defined in <<_stix_patterning_2>>.

==== STIX Common Properties

STIX Domain Objects (SDOs) and Relationship Objects (SROs) all share a common set of properties which provide core capabilities such as versioning and data markings (representing how data can be shared and used).
All STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) likewise share a common set of properties that are applicable for all SCOs. Similarly, STIX Meta Objects (SMOs) use some but not all of the common properties.

==== STIX Open Vocabularies and Enumerations

Some STIX properties are defined using open vocabularies or enumerations.
Enumerations and open vocabularies are defined in STIX in order to enhance interoperability by increasing the likelihood that different entities use the same exact string to represent the same concept.
If used consistently, open vocabularies make it less likely that one entity refers to the energy sector as "Energy" and another as "Energy Sector", thereby making comparison and correlation easier.

While using predefined values from STIX vocabularies is strongly encouraged, in some cases this may not be feasible.
To address this, producers are permitted to use values outside of the open vocabulary.
In the case of enumerations, producers are required to use only the values defined within the STIX specification.

STIX open vocabularies and enumerations are defined in <<_stix_vocabularies>>.
Properties that are defined as open vocabularies identify a suggested vocabulary from that section.
For example, the Threat Actor *sophistication* property, as defined in <<_threat_actor>>, uses the Threat Actor Sophistication vocabulary as defined in <<_threat_actor_sophistication_vocabulary>>.

==== Reserved Names

Reserved property names are marked with a type called [stixtype]#RESERVED# and a description text of "RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE". For more information please see <<_reserved_names_2>>].

==== Serialization

STIX is defined independent of any specific storage or serialization.
However, the mandatory-to-implement (MTI) serialization for STIX 2.1 is UTF-8 encoded JSON as defined in <<RFC7493>> and <<RFC8259>>, which uses the JSON Object type described within when representing all STIX Objects.
In other words, all STIX-conformant tools have to implement support for JSON but can implement support for other serializations.

==== Transporting STIX

STIX 2.1 is transport-agnostic, i.e., the structures and serializations do not rely on any specific transport mechanism.
A companion CTI specification, xref:RelatedWork[TAXII], is designed specifically to transport STIX Objects.
STIX provides a Bundle (see <<_stix_bundle_object>>) as a container for STIX Objects to allow for transportation of bulk STIX data, especially over non-TAXII communication mechanisms.

==== JSON Schemas

JSON schemas have been developed by members of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee.
The JSON schemas are informative and serve as a best effort attempt to validate that STIX 2.1 content meets the structural requirements identified in this specification.
This specification is the normative description of STIX 2.1.

== Common Data Types

This section defines the common types used throughout STIX for all STIX Objects.
These types will be referenced by the "Type" column in other sections.
This section defines the names and permitted values of common types that are used in the STIX information model; it does not, however, define the meaning of any properties using these types.
These types may be further restricted elsewhere in the document.

The table below is a summary of the data types defined in this section.

[width="100%",cols="29%,71%",]

|===


=== Binary

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#binary#

The [stixtype]#binary# data type represents a sequence of bytes.
In order to allow pattern matching on custom objects, for all properties that use the binary type, the property name *MUST* end with '_bin'.

The JSON MTI serialization represents this as a base64-­encoded string as specified in <<RFC4648>>​.
Other serializations *SHOULD* use a native binary type, if available.

=== Boolean

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#boolean#

A [stixtype]#boolean# is a value of either true or false.
Properties with this type *MUST* have a value of [stixliteral]#true# or [stixliteral]#false#.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the true and false (boolean) values from the JSON values <<RFC8259>>, which are a literal (unquoted) true or false.

*Examples*

--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "summary": true,
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Dictionary ===

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#dictionary#

A [stixtype]#dictionary# captures an arbitrary set of key/value pairs.
Dictionary keys *MUST* be unique in each dictionary, *MUST* be in ASCII, and are limited to the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), A-Z (uppercase ASCII), numerals 0-9, hyphen (-), and underscore (_).
Dictionary keys *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length and *SHOULD* be lowercase.

Empty dictionaries are prohibited in STIX and *MUST NOT* be used as a substitute for omitting the property if it is optional.
If the property is required, the dictionary *MUST* be present and *MUST* have at least one key-value pair.

[stixtype]#dictionary# values *MUST* be valid property base types.

=== Enum

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#enum#

The [stixtype]#enum# type is a hardcoded list of terms that is represented as a [stixtype]#string#.
For properties that use this type there is a defined list of values that is identified in the definition for said properties.
The STIX Enumerations are defined in <<_stix_vocabularies>>.
Terms defined in an [stixtype]#enum# by the specification *MUST NOT* be expanded by implementations.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON String type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#enum# enumeration.

=== External Reference

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#external-reference#

External references are used to describe pointers to information represented outside of STIX.
For example, a Malware object could use an external reference to indicate an ID for that malware in an external database or a report could use references to represent source material.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type [xref:RFC8259[RFC8259]] when representing [stixtype]#external-reference#.

==== Properties

[width="100%",cols="35%,19%,46%",options="header"]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*source_name* (required) |[stixtype]#string# |The name of the source that the [stixtype]#external-reference# is defined within (system, registry, organization, etc.).

|*description* (optional) |[stixtype]#string# |A human readable description.

|*url* (optional) |[stixtype]#string# |A URL reference to an external resource <<RFC3986>>.

|*hashes* (optional) |[stixtype]#hashes#|
Specifies a dictionary of hashes for the contents of the *url*. This *SHOULD* be provided when the *url* property is present.

Dictionary keys *MUST* come from one of the entries listed in the [stixvocab]#<<_hashing_algorithm_vocabulary,hash-algorithm-ov>>#.

As stated in <<_hashes>>, to ensure interoperability, a SHA-256 hash *SHOULD* be included whenever possible.

|*external_id* (optional) |[stixtype]#string# |An identifier for the external reference content.

|===

==== Requirements

* In addition to the *source_name* property, at least one of the *description*, *url*, or *external_id* properties *MUST* be present.

*Examples*

      "description": "Threat report"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Float

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#float#

The float data type represents an IEEE 754 [xref:IEEE7542008[IEEE 754-2008]] double-precision number (e.g., a number with a fractional part).
However, because the values ±Infinity and NaN are not representable in JSON, they are not valid values in STIX.

In the JSON MTI serialization, floating point values are represented by the JSON Number type <<RFC7493>>.


*Examples*

--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "distance": 8.321,
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Hashes

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#hashes#

The Hashes type represents one or more cryptographic hashes, as a special set of key/value pairs.
Accordingly, the name of each hashing algorithm *MUST* be specified as a key in the dictionary and *MUST* identify the name of the hashing algorithm used to generate the corresponding value.
This name *SHOULD* come from one of the values defined in the [stixvocab]#<<_hashing_algorithm_vocabulary,hash-algorithm-ov>># open vocabulary.

Dictionary keys *MUST* be unique in each [stixtype]#hashes# property, *MUST* be in ASCII, and are limited to the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), A-Z (uppercase ASCII), numerals 0-9, hyphen (-), and underscore (_).
Dictionary keys *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters and *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
The value *MUST* be a [stixtype]#string# in the appropriate format defined by the hash type indicated in the dictionary key.

To enhance compatibility, the SHA-256 hash *SHOULD* be used whenever possible.


*Examples*

_SHA-256 and User-Defined Hash_

--------------------------------------
{
  "SHA-256": "6db12788c37247f2316052e142f42f4b259d6561751e5f401a1ae2a6df9c674b",
  "x_foo_hash": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0123457890"
}
--------------------------------------

=== Hexadecimal

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#hex#

The [stixtype]#hex# data type encodes an array of octets (8-bit bytes) as hexadecimal. 
The string *MUST* consist of an even number of hexadecimal characters, which are the digits '0' through '9' and the lower-case letters 'a' through 'f'. 
In order to allow pattern matching on custom objects, for all properties that use the [stixtype]*hex* type, the property name *MUST* end with '_hex'.

*Examples*

--------------------------------------
...
  "src_flags_hex": "00000002"
...
--------------------------------------

=== Identifier

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#identifier#

An [stixtype]#identifier# uniquely identifies a STIX Object and *MAY* do so in a deterministic way.
A deterministic [stixtype]#identifier# means that the [stixtype]#identifier# generated by more than one producer for the exact same STIX Object using the same namespace, "ID Contributing Properties", and UUID method will have the exact same [stixtype]#identifier# value.

All [stixtype]#identifiers#, excluding those used in the deprecated Cyber Observable Container, *MUST* follow the form [stixalt]#__object-type__--_UUID_#, where [stixalt]_object-type_ is the exact value (all type names are lowercase strings, by definition) from the [stixtype]#type# property of the object being identified or referenced and where the [stixalt]_UUID_ *MUST* be an RFC 4122-compliant UUID <<RFC4122>>.

The [stixalt]_UUID_ part of the [stixtype]#identifier# *MUST* be unique across all objects produced by a given producer regardless of the type identified by the [stixalt]_object-type_ prefix.
Meaning, a producer *MUST NOT* reuse the [stixalt]_UUID_ portion of the [stixtype]#identifier# for objects of different types.

STIX Domain Objects, STIX Relationship Objects, STIX Meta Objects, and STIX Bundle Object *SHOULD* use UUIDv4 for the [stixalt]_UUID_ portion of the [stixtype]#identifier#.
Producers using something other than UUIDv4 need to be mindful of potential collisions and should use a namespace that guarantees uniqueness, however, they *MUST NOT* use a namespace of [stixliteral]#00abedb4-aa42-466c-9c01-fed23315a9b7# if generating a UUIDv5.

STIX Cyber-observable Objects *SHOULD* use UUIDv5 for the [stixalt]_UUID_ portion of the [stixtype]#identifier# and the [stixalt]_UUID_ portion of the UUIDv5-based [stixtype]#identifier# *SHOULD* be generated according to the following rules:

* The namespace *SHOULD* be [stixliteral]#00abedb4-aa42-466c-9c01-fed23315a9b7#. This defined namespace is necessary to support the goal of deduplication and semantic equivalence of some STIX objects in the community of producers.
* The value of the name portion *SHOULD* be the list of "ID Contributing Properties" (property-name and property value pairs) as defined on each SCO object and *SHOULD* be represented as a JSON object that is then serialized / stringified according to <<RFC8785>> to ensure a canonical representation of the JSON data.
* If the contributing properties are all optional, and none are present on the SCO, then a UUIDv4 *MUST* be used.
* Producers not following these rules *MUST NOT* use a namespace of [stixliteral]#00abedb4-aa42-466c-9c01-fed23315a9b7# and *SHOULD* use UUIDv4 in cases where the id would not be unique.

STIX Cyber-observable Objects that are used in the deprecated Cyber Observable Container *MAY* use any [stixtype]#string# value for the [stixtype]#identifier#.
For the deprecated Cyber Observable Container, it is common for implementers to use simple numerical strings for these [stixtype]#identifiers# (e.g., "0", "1", "2", etc.).
See <<_observable_container_deprecated>> for more information.

* These identifiers, when used inside the deprecated Cyber-observable Objects Container specify a local reference to a Cyber-observable Object. These references *MUST* be valid within the local scope of the Cyber Observable Container ([stixtype]#observable-container#) that holds both the source Cyber-observable Object and the Cyber-observable Object that it references.

* These identifiers *SHOULD* be a non-negative monotonically increasing integer, incrementing by 1 from a starting value of 0, and represented as a string within the JSON MTI serialization. However, implementers *MAY* elect to use an alternate key format if necessary.

Using Identifiers: +
Consumers of STIX Cyber Threat Intelligence that are processing the *objects* property of an [stixtype]#Observed-Data# object can assume that the [stixtype]#identifier# is an old deprecated Cyber Observable Container [stixtype]#identifier#.
Consumers can also inspect the [stixtype]#identifier# to see if it contains an [stixalt]_object-type_, if not, they can assume that it is a deprecated Cyber Observable Container [stixtype]#identifier#.
If it does have an [stixalt]_object-type_ and it matches a SCO, then chances are it is a UUIDv5 deterministic [stixtype]#identifier#, but this can be verified by inspecting the [stixalt]_UUID_ portion of the identifier.
<<RFC4122>> defines how one can distinguish between a UUIDv4 and UUIDv5 value.

NOTE: Please see the security considerations section in <<_iana_considerations>> for information about using UUIDv5.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON String type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#identifier#.

*​Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "type": "indicator",
  "id": "indicator--e2e1a340-4415-4ba8-9671-f7343fbf0836",
  ...
}

{
  "type": "ipv4-addr",
  "id": "ipv4-addr--28bb3599-77cd-5a82-a950-b5bc3caf07c4",
  "value": "198.51.100.3"
}
--------------------------------------

Deprecated Cyber Observable Container Identifiers
--------------------------------------
{
  "0": {
    "type": "ipv4-addr",
    "value": "198.51.100.2"
  },

  "1": {
    "type": "network-traffic",
    "dst_ref": "0"
  }
}
--------------------------------------

=== Integer

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#integer#

The integer data type represents a whole number.
Unless otherwise specified, all integers *MUST* be capable of being represented as a signed 54-bit value ([-(2{star}{star}53)+1, (2{star}{star}53)-1]) as defined in <<RFC7493>>.
Additional restrictions *MAY* be placed on the type as described where it is used.
The integer size is limited to a 54-bit value not a 64-bit value as per the RFC.

In the JSON MTI serialization, integers are represented by the JSON Number type <<RFC7493>>.

*Examples*

--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "count": 8,
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Kill Chain Phase

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#kill-chain-phase#

The [stixtype]#kill-chain-phase# represents a phase in a kill chain, which describes the various phases an attacker may undertake in order to achieve their objectives.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#kill-chain-phase#.

[width="100%",cols="37%,23%,40%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*kill_chain_name* (required) 
|[stixtype]#string# 
|The name of the kill chain.
The value of this property *SHOULD* be all lowercase and *SHOULD* use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores as word separators.

|*phase_name* (required)# 
|[stixtype]#string# 
|The name of the phase in the kill chain.
The value of this property *SHOULD* be all lowercase and *SHOULD* use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores as word separators.
|===

When referencing a kill chain, the *kill_chain_name* property *MUST* be the name of that kill chain.


*Examples*

Example specifying the "pre-attack" phase from the "foo" kill chain

--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "kill_chain_phases": [
    {
      "kill_chain_name": "foo",
      "phase_name": "pre-attack"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

Example specifying the "pre-attack" phase from the "foo" kill-chain

--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "kill_chain_phases": [
    {
      "kill_chain_name": "foo",
      "phase_name": "pre-attack"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== List

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#list#

The [stixtype]#list# type defines a sequence of values ordered based on how they appear in the list.
The phrasing "[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#<type>#" is used to indicate that all values within the list *MUST* conform to the specified type.
For instance, [stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#integer# means that all values of the list must be of the [stixtype]#integer# type.
This specification does not specify the maximum number of allowed values in a [stixtype]#list#; however, every instance of a [stixtype]#list# *MUST* have at least one value.
Specific STIX Object properties may define more restrictive upper and/or lower bounds for the length of the list.

Empty lists are prohibited in STIX and *MUST NOT* be used as a substitute for omitting the property if it is optional.
If the property is required, the list *MUST* be present and *MUST* have at least one value.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Array type <<RFC8259>>, which is an ordered list of zero or more values.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "observed_data_refs": [
    "observed-data--b67d30ff-02ac-498a-92f9-32f845f448cf",
    "observed-data--c96f4120-2b4b-47c3-b61f-eceaa54bd9c6",
    "observed-data--787710c9-1988-4a1b-9761-a2de5e19c62f"
  ],
  ...
}
--------------------------------------


=== Observable Container (deprecated)

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#observable-container#

Representing Cyber-observable Objects in an Observable Container has been deprecated and *SHOULD NOT* be used when creating new content.
Existing Observable Data objects using Observable Containers may contain SCOs as defined in this specification, but also may contain Cyber-observable Objects as described in version 2.0 of STIX (xref:RelatedWork[_STIX Version 2.0. Part 3: STIX Objects_]).

The Observable Container type can contain one or more STIX Cyber-observable Objects as a special set of key/value pairs.
The keys in the dictionary are the references used to refer to an object which is located in the observable container as a value to some key.
The value of this "key" is a reference that can be used in the embedded relationship properties in other objects, which *MUST* be in the same container (such as the src_ref property on the Network Traffic object).

Resolving a reference is the process of identifying all of the objects in an observable container by their "key" reference value.
References resolve to an object when the value of the property (e.g., src_ref) is an exact match with the key of another object that resides in the same container as the object that specifies the reference.
All such references are local to the container and the referenced object *MUST* be provided within the same container.
This specification does not address the implementation of reference resolution. Each key in the observable container dictionary is an identifier.

*STIX 2.0 Examples*

_Network Traffic with Source/Destination IPv4 Addresses and AS_
--------------------------------------
{
  "0": {
    "type": "ipv4-addr",
    "value": "1.2.3.4",
    "belongs_to_refs": ["3"]
  },
  "1": {
    "type": "ipv4-addr",
    "value": "2.3.4.5"
  },
  "2": {
    "type": "network-traffic",
    "src_ref": "0",
    "dst_ref": "1",
  }
  "3": {
    "type": "as"
    "number": 42
  }
}

{
  "0": {
    "type": "email-addr",
    "value": "jdoe@example.com",
    "display_name": "John Doe"
  },
  "1": {
    "type": "email-addr",
    "value": "mary@example.com",
    "display_name": "Mary Smith"
  },
  "2": {
    "type": "email-message",
    "from_ref": "0",
    "to_refs": ["1"],
    "date": "1997-11-21T15:55:06Z",
    "subject": "Saying Hello"
  }
}
--------------------------------------

=== Open Vocabulary

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#open-vocab#

The [stixtype]#open-vocab# type is represented as a [stixtype]#string#.
For properties that use this type there will be a list of suggested values, known as the suggested vocabulary, that is identified in the definition for that property.
The suggested vocabularies are defined in <<_stix_vocabularies>>.
The value of the property *SHOULD* be chosen from the suggested vocabulary, but *MAY* be any other [stixtype]#string# value.
Values that are not from the suggested vocabulary *SHOULD* be all lowercase and *SHOULD* use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores as word separators.

A consumer that receives STIX content with one or more [stixtype]#open-vocab# terms not defined in the suggested vocabulary *MAY* ignore those values.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON String type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#open-vocab#.

*Examples*

Example using value from the suggested vocabulary.
In this example the Threat Actor *sophistication* property is an open vocabulary and we are using one of the suggested vocabulary values.
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "sophistication": "intermediate",
  ...
}
--------------------------------------
Example using a user-defined value.
In this example, for the same Threat Actor *sophistication* property, we are not using a value in the suggested vocabulary.
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "sophistication": "pbx-advanced-activity",
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== String

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#string#

The [stixtype]#string# data type represents a finite-length string of valid characters from the Unicode coded character set <<ISO10646>>.
Unicode incorporates ASCII and the characters of many other international character sets.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON String type <<RFC8259>>, which mandates the UTF-8 encoding for supporting Unicode.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "name": "The Black Vine Cyberespionage Group",
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Timestamp

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#timestamp#

The [stixtype]#timestamp# type defines how dates and times are represented in STIX.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON String type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#timestamp#.

==== Requirements

* The [stixtype]#timestamp# property *MUST* be a valid RFC 3339-formatted timestamp <<RFC3339>> using the format [stixalt]#YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss[.s+]Z# where the "s+" represents 1 or more sub-second values.
The brackets denote that sub-second precision is optional, and that if no digits are provided, the decimal place *MUST NOT* be present.
* The timestamp *MUST* be represented in the UTC timezone and *MUST* use the "Z" designation to indicate this.

Note when using precisions greater than nanoseconds there may be implications for interoperability as they may be truncated when stored as a UNIX timestamp or floating point number due to the fundamental precision of those formats.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "created": "2016-01-20T12:31:12.123Z",
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

== STIX General Concepts

=== Property Names and String Literals

All type names, property names, and literals *MUST* be in lowercase, except when referencing canonical names defined in another standard (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry).
Lowercase is defined by the locality conventions.
Type names and property names *MUST* begin with a letter character (for example - in ASCII that would be a through z).
Words in property names *MUST* be separated with an underscore (\_), while words in type names and string enumerations *MUST* be separated with a hyphen (-).
Dictionary key and hash algorithm names *MAY* have underscores (_) or hyphens (-).
All type names, property names, object names, and vocabulary terms *MUST* be between three and 250 characters long.

Certain names of properties *MUST* have specific suffixes.

* If the value of the property contains an ID reference for embedded relationships it *MUST* end in *_ref*
* If the value of the property contains a list of embedded relationships it *MUST* end in *_refs*.
* If the value of the property contains a binary value, it *MUST* end in *_bin*.
* If the value of the property contains a hexadecimal value, it *MUST* end in *_hex*.
* A property might contain a string with an alternative encoding.
Some object types will define an additional optional property to specify this encoding. The name of the additional property *MUST* end in *_enc*.
For example, the *name* property might contain text in an alternative encoding, and the *name_enc* property would be used to specify which encoding is used.
The encoding property *MUST NOT* be present when the original property is not present.

In the JSON serialization all property names and string literals *MUST* be exactly the same, including case, as the names listed in the property tables in this specification.
For example, the SDO common property *created_by_ref* must result in the JSON key name "created_by_ref".
Properties marked required in the property tables *MUST* be present in the JSON serialization.

Some properties may be designated as "deprecated".
These properties are in the process of being removed or replaced and implementers should consider using the newer designs.

=== Common Properties

This section defines the common properties that *MAY* exist on a STIX Objects.
While some STIX Objects use all of these common properties, not all object types do.
Each type of STIX Object defines which common properties are required, which are optional, and which are not in use.
A comparison summary table is provided below in this section. This information can also be found at the start of the properties table for each object.

[width="100%",cols="26%,23%,51%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*type*
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *type* property identifies the type of STIX Object.
The value of the *type* property *MUST* be the name of one of the types of STIX Objects defined in <<_stix_domain_objects_2>>, <<_stix_relationship_objects>>, <<_stix_cyber_observable_objects_2>>, and <<_stix_meta_objects>> (e.g., [stixliteral]#indicator#) or the name of a Custom Object as defined by section <<_custom_objects_deprecated>>.

|*spec_version*
|[stixtype]#string#
|The version of the STIX specification used to represent this object.

The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#2.1# for STIX Objects defined according to this specification.

Since SCOs are now top-level objects in STIX 2.1, the default value for SCOs is [stixliteral]#2.1#.

|*id*
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *id* property uniquely identifies this object.

For objects that support versioning, all objects with the same *id* are considered different versions of the same object and the version of the object is identified by its *modified* property.

|*created_by_ref*
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *created_by_ref* property specifies the *id* property of the [stixtype]#identity# object that describes the entity that created this object.

If this attribute is omitted, the source of this information is undefined.
This may be used by object creators who wish to remain anonymous.

|*created*
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The *created* property represents the time at which the object was originally created.

The object creator can use the time it deems most appropriate as the time the object was created.
The minimum precision *MUST* be milliseconds (three digits after the decimal place in seconds), but *MAY* be more precise.

The *created* property *MUST NOT* be changed when creating a new version of the object.

See <<_versioning>> for further definition of versioning.

|*modified*
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The *modified* property is only used by STIX Objects that support versioning and represents the time that this particular version of the object was last modified.

The object creator can use the time it deems most appropriate as the time this version of the object was modified.
The minimum precision *MUST* be milliseconds (three digits after the decimal place in seconds), but *MAY* be more precise.

If the *created* property is defined, then the value of the *modified* property for a given object version *MUST* be later than or equal to the value of the *created* property.

Object creators *MUST* set the *modified* property when creating a new version of an object if the *created* property was set.

See <<_versioning>> for further definition of versioning.

|*revoked*
|[stixtype]#boolean#
|The *revoked* property is only used by STIX Objects that support versioning and indicates whether the object has been revoked.

Revoked objects are no longer considered valid by the object creator.
Revoking an object is permanent; future versions of the object with this *id* *MUST NOT* be created.

The default value of this property is [stixliteral]#false#.

See <<_versioning>> for further definition of versioning.

|*labels*
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#string#
|The *labels* property specifies a set of terms used to describe this object.
The terms are user-defined or trust-group defined and their meaning is outside the scope of this specification and *MAY* be ignored.

Where an object has a specific property defined in the specification for characterizing subtypes of that object, the labels property *MUST NOT* be used for that purpose.

For example, the Malware SDO has a property *malware_types* that contains a list of Malware subtypes (dropper, RAT, etc.).
In this example, the labels property cannot be used to describe these Malware subtypes.

|*confidence*
|[stixtype]#integer#
|The *confidence* property identifies the confidence that the creator has in the correctness of their data.
The confidence value *MUST* be a number in the range of 0-100.

<<_confidence_scales>> contains a table of normative mappings to other confidence scales that *MUST* be used when presenting the confidence value in one of those scales.

If the confidence property is not present, then the confidence of the content is unspecified.

|*lang* 
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *lang* property identifies the language of the text content in this object.
When present, it *MUST* be a language code conformant to <<RFC5646>>.
If the property is not present, then the language of the content is [stixliteral]#en# (English).

This property *SHOULD* be present if the object type contains translatable text properties (e.g. name, description).

The language of individual fields in this object *MAY* be overridden by the *lang* property in granular markings (see <<_granular_markings>>).

|*external_references* 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#external-reference# 
|The *external_references* property specifies a list of external references which refers to non-STIX information.
This property is used to provide one or more URLs, descriptions, or IDs to records in other systems.

|*object_marking_refs* 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#
|The *object_marking_refs* property specifies a list of *id* properties of [stixtype]#marking-definition# objects that apply to this object.

In some cases, though uncommon, marking definitions themselves may be marked with sharing or handling guidance. In this case, this property *MUST NOT* contain any references to the same Marking Definition object (i.e., it cannot contain any circular references).

See <<_data_markings>> for further definition of data markings.

|*granular_markings* 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#granular-marking#
|The *granular_markings* property specifies a list of granular markings applied to this object.

In some cases, though uncommon, marking definitions themselves may be marked with sharing or handling guidance.
In this case, this property *MUST NOT* contain any references to the same Marking Definition object (i.e., it cannot contain any circular references).

See <<_data_markings>> for further definition of data markings.

|*defanged* 
|[stixtype]#boolean#
|This property defines whether or not the data contained within the object has been defanged.

The default value for this property is [stixliteral]#false#.

This property *MUST NOT* be used on any STIX Objects other than SCOs.

|*extensions*
|[stixtype]#dictionary#
|Specifies any extensions of the object, as a dictionary.

Dictionary keys *SHOULD* be the id of a STIX Extension object or the name of a predefined object extension found in this specification, depending on the type of extension being used.

The corresponding dictionary values *MUST* contain the contents of the extension instance.

Each extension dictionary *MAY* contain the property *extension_type*.
The value of this property *MUST* come from the [stixtype]#extension-type-enum# enumeration.
If the *extension_type* property is not present, then this is a predefined extension which does not use the extension facility described in <<_extension_definition>>.
When this extension facility is used the *extension_type* property *MUST* be present.

=== Object IDs and References

All STIX Objects and the STIX Bundle Object have an *id* property that uniquely identifies each instance of the object.
This *id* *MUST* meet the requirements of the [stixtype]#identifier# type (see <<_identifier>>).

The [stixtype]#identifier# type is also used as an ID reference to define a relationship to other STIX Objects. 
Resolving an ID reference is the process of identifying and obtaining the actual object referred to by the ID reference property.
ID references resolve to an object when the value of the ID reference property (e.g., *created_by_ref*) is an exact match with the *id* property of another object. 
If a consumer has access to multiple versions of an object, the consumer *SHOULD* interpret any references to that object as referring to the latest version as defined in <<_versioning>>.
ID references can refer to objects to which the consumer/producer may not currently have. This specification does not address the implementation of ID reference resolution.

Some ID references (embedded relationships) may be restricted to a subset of object types, as specified in the description of the property that defines the relationship. For example, the *object_marking_refs* common property specifies that the only valid target of the relationship is one or more [stixtype]#marking-definition# objects.

=== SCO Deterministic ID Creation

To enable deterministic IDs for STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs), each SCO defines a set of one or more properties named "ID Contributing Properties".
These properties *MAY* be used in the default calculation of the *id* when creating a SCO.
In some cases, additional selection of extension properties that contribute to the ID may be described in the ID Contributing Properties section listed on each SCO.
The default algorithm that creates the SCO ID based on those named properties is a UUIDv5 as defined in <<_identifier>>, however, other algorithms for creating the SCO ID *MAY* be used.

Deterministic IDs (UUIDv5) in the example SCOs contained in this specification were computed using the algorithm defined in <<_identifier>>.
Every attempt was made for these IDs to be accurate.
Certain IDs which were used in reference properties of the examples did not include the actual object, and therefore it was impossible to accurately compute the appropriate UUIDv5.
In these cases, a UUIDv4 was generated.

=== Object Creator

The object creator is the entity (e.g., system, organization, instance of a tool) that generates the *id* property for a given object.
Object creators are represented as Identity objects.
Some STIX Objects allow this designation (see <<_common_properties>>).
An embedded relationship to the Identity object representing the object creator *SHOULD* be captured in the *created_by_ref* property (or that property can be omitted, meaning the object creator is anonymous).

Entities that re-publish an object from another entity without making any changes to the object, and thus maintaining the original *id*, are not considered the object creator and *MUST NOT* change the *created_by_ref* property.
An entity that accepts objects and republishes them with modifications, additions, or omissions *MUST* create a new *id* for the object.
They are considered the object creator of the new object for purposes of versioning.

=== Versioning

Versioning is the mechanism that object creators use to update and revoke the STIX Objects that they create.
This section describes the versioning process and normative rules for performing versioning and revocation.
STIX Objects that are versioned *MUST* use the property names *created_by_ref*, *created*, *modified*, and *revoked*.
SCOs are not versioned and thus do not have the four versioning properties. See the properties table in <<_common_properties>> for full definitions and normative usage of those properties.

STIX Objects *MAY* be versioned in order to update, add, or remove information.
A version of a STIX Object is identified uniquely by the combination of its *id* and *modified* properties.
The first version of the object *MUST* have the same timestamp for the *created* and *modified* properties.
More recent values of the *modified* property indicate later versions of the object.
Implementations *MUST* consider the version of the STIX Object with the most recent *modified* value to be the most recent state of the object.
For every new version of an object, the *modified* property *MUST* be updated to represent the time that the new version was created.
If a consumer receives two objects that are different, but have the same *id* and *modified* timestamp, it is not defined how the consumer handles the objects.
This specification does not address how implementations should handle versions of the object that are not current.

STIX Objects have a single _object creator_, the entity that generates the *id* for the object and creates the first version.
The object creator *MAY* (but not necessarily will) be identified in the *created_by_ref* property of the object.
Only the object creator is permitted to create new versions of a STIX Object.
Producers other than the object creator *MUST NOT* create new versions of that object.
If a producer other than the object creator wishes to create a new version, they *MUST* instead create a new object with a new *id*.
They *SHOULD* additionally create a [stixliteral]#derived-from# Relationship object to relate their new object to the original object that it was derived from.

Every representation (each time the object version is serialized and shared) of a version of an object (identified by the object's *id* and *modified* properties) *MUST* always have the same set of properties and the same values for each property.
If a property has the same value as the default, it *MAY* be omitted from a representation, and this does not represent a change to the object.
In order to change the value of any property, or to add or remove properties, the *modified* property *MUST* be updated with the time of the change to indicate a new version.

Objects can also be revoked, which means that they are no longer considered valid by the object creator.
As with issuing a new version, only the object creator is permitted to revoke a STIX Object.
A value of [stixliteral]#true# in the *revoked* property indicates that an object (including the current version and all past versions) has been revoked.
Revocation is permanent: once an object is marked as revoked, later versions of that object *MUST NOT* be created.
Changing the *revoked* property to indicate that an object is revoked is an update to the object, and therefore its *modified* property *MUST* be updated at the same time.
This specification does not address how implementations should handle revoked data.

It should be noted that if a producer versions a SCO (assigns value to these four properties) that no other producer would be allowed to create or modify the same SCO with an equivalent deterministic *id*, as that would conflict with the strict versioning rules defined in STIX2.
Therefore, for interoperability and sharing, producers versioning SCOs *MUST NOT* use the default namespace for deterministic ID creation.
Otherwise multiple different producers will conflict with each other if producing the same SCO intelligence.

==== Versioning Timestamps

There are two timestamp properties used to indicate when STIX Objects were created and modified: *created* and *modified*.
The *created* property indicates the time the first version of the object was created.
The *modified* property indicates the time the specific version of the object was created.
The *modified* time *MUST NOT* be earlier than the *created* time.
This specification does not address the specifics of how implementations should determine the value of the creation and modification times for use in the *created* and *modified* properties (e.g., one system might use when the object is first added to the local database as the creation time, while another might use the time when the object is first distributed as STIX).

==== New Version or New Object?

Eventually an implementation will encounter a case where a decision must be made regarding whether a change is a new version of an existing object or is different enough that it is a new object.
This is generally considered a data quality problem and therefore this specification does not provide any normative text.

However, to assist implementers and promote consistency across implementations, some rules of thumb are provided.
Any time a change indicates a _material change_ to the meaning of the object, a new object with a different *id* should be used.
A material change is any change that the object creator believes substantively changes the meaning of the object.
As an example, an object creator might consider changing a Threat Actor from one country to another is a material change.
These decisions are always made by the object creator.
The object creator should also think about relationships to the object when deciding if a change is material.
If the change would invalidate the usefulness of relationships to the object, then the change is considered material and a new object *id* should be used.

*Examples*

_Example of a new version_

One object creator has decided that the previous name they used for an SDO is incorrect. 
They consider that change as an update to the object.

_Note: the IDs in the example below use a simplified format to help illustrate the changing IDs more clearly._

|===

=== Common Relationships

Each SDO and SCO has its own set of relationship types that are specified in the definition of that SDO or SCO.
The following common relationship types are defined for all SDOs and SCOs.
See <<_stix_relationships>> for more information about relationships.

[width="100%",cols="19%,20%,21%,40%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Relationship Type* |[stixtr]*Source* |[stixtr]*Target* |[stixtr]*Description*

|[stixliteral]#derived-from# 
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of same type as target>_ 
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of same type as source>_ 
|The information in the target object is based on information from the source object.

[stixliteral]#derived-from# is an explicit relationship between two separate objects and *MUST NOT* be used as a substitute for the versioning process defined in <<_versioning>>.

|[stixliteral]#duplicate-of# 
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of same type as target>_ 
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of same type as source>_ 
|The referenced source and target objects are semantically duplicates of each other.

This specification does not address whether the source or the target object is the duplicate object or what action, if any, a consumer should take when receiving an instance of this relationship.

As an example, a Campaign object from one organization could be marked as a [stixliteral]#duplicate-of# a Campaign object from another organization if they both described the same campaign.

|[stixliteral]#related-to#
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of any type>_
|[stixtype]_<SDO or SCO of any type>_
|Asserts a non-specific relationship between two SDOs.
This relationship can be used when none of the other predefined relationships are appropriate, and a user-defined one is not needed.

As an example, a Malware object describing a piece of malware could be marked as a [stixliteral]#related-to# a Tool if they are commonly used together.
That relationship is not common enough to standardize but may be useful to some analysts.

|===

=== Reserved Names

This section defines property names that are reserved for future revisions of this document.
The property names defined in this section and any property name that is marked as [stixtype]#RESERVED# *MUST NOT* be used for the name of any Custom Property or be present in any STIX content conforming to this version of the specification.

Properties that are currently reserved across all STIX Objects are:

* [stixtype]#severity#
* [stixtype]#username#
* [stixtype]#phone_number#
* [stixtype]#action#

=== Object Property Metadata

==== SCO String Encoding

Capturing the observed encoding of a particular STIX Cyber-observable Object (SCO) string is useful for attribution, the creation of indicators, and related use cases.

Certain string properties in STIX Cyber-observable Objects may contain an additional sibling property with the same base name and a suffix of *_enc* that captures the name of the original observed encoding of the property value. 
All *_enc* properties *MUST* specify their encoding using the corresponding name from the IANA character set registry <<CharacterSets>>.
If the preferred MIME name for a character set is defined, this value *MUST* be used; if it is not defined, then the Name value from the registry *MUST* be used instead.

*Examples*

_File with Unicode representation of the filename and a corresponding encoding specification_
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "file",
  "id": "file-1389b98d-a3d3-5190-a996-716fd444059a",
  "hashes": {
    "SHA-256": "effb46bba03f6c8aea5c653f9cf984f170dcdd3bbbe2ff6843c3e5da0e698766"
  },
  "name": "quêry.dll",
  "name_enc": "windows-1252"
}
--------------------------------------

=== Predefined Object Extensions

Predefined Object Extensions have a specific purpose in STIX Objects: defining coherent sets of properties beyond the base, e.g., HTTP request information for a Network Traffic object.
Accordingly, each object may include one or more Predefined Object Extensions.

Each Predefined Object Extension can be defined at most once on a given STIX Object.
Each extension is specified under the *extensions* property, which is of type [stixtype]#dictionary#.
Note that this means that each extension is specified through a corresponding key in the [stixtype]#extensions# property.
For example, when specified in a File object instance, the NTFS extension would be specified using the key value of [stixtype]#ntfs-ext#.

*Examples*

_Basic File with NTFS Extension_
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "file",
  "spec_version": "2.1",
  "id": "file--1b40e321-ae73-5637-bd97-33c35a86b80d",

    "ntfs-ext": {
      "sid": "1234567"
    }

== STIX Domain Objects

This specification defines the set of STIX Domain Objects (SDOs), each of which corresponds to a unique concept commonly represented in CTI.
Using SDOs, STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs), and STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) as building blocks, individuals can create and share broad and comprehensive cyber threat intelligence.

Property information, relationship information, and examples are provided for each SDO defined below.
Property information includes common properties as well as properties that are specific to each SDO.
Relationship information includes embedded relationships (e.g., *created_by_ref*), common relationships (e.g., [stixliteral]#related-to#), and SDO-specific relationships.
Forward relationships (i.e., relationships _from_ the SDO to other SDOs or SCOs) are fully defined, while reverse relationships (i.e., relationships _to_ the SDO from other SDOs or SCOs) are duplicated for convenience.

Some SDOs are similar and can be grouped together into categories.
Attack Pattern, Malware, and Tool can all be considered types of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): they describe behaviors and resources that attackers use to carry out their attacks.
Similarly, Campaign, Intrusion Set, and Threat Actor all describe information about why adversaries carry out attacks and how they organize themselves.

=== Attack Pattern

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#attack-pattern#

Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets.
Attack Patterns are used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks are performed.
An example of an attack pattern is "spear phishing": a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware.
Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.

The Attack Pattern SDO contains textual descriptions of the pattern along with references to externally-defined taxonomies of attacks such as CAPEC <<CAPEC>>.

=== Campaign

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#campaign#

A Campaign is a grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur over a period of time against a specific set of targets.
Campaigns usually have well defined objectives and may be part of an Intrusion Set.

Campaigns are often attributed to an intrusion set and threat actors.
The threat actors may reuse known infrastructure from the intrusion set or may set up new infrastructure specific for conducting that campaign.

Campaigns can be characterized by their objectives and the incidents they cause, people or resources they target, and the resources (infrastructure, intelligence, Malware, Tools, etc.) they use.

For example, a Campaign could be used to describe a crime syndicate's attack using a specific variant of malware and new C2 servers against the executives of ACME Bank during the summer of 2016 in order to gain secret information about an upcoming merger with another bank.

=== Course of Action

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#course-of-action#

NOTE: *The Course of Action object in STIX 2.1 is a stub.
It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing prose courses of action) but does not support the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of action.
Future STIX 2 releases will expand it to include these capabilities.*

A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress.
It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe higher level actions like employee training or policy changes.
For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.

The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved *action* property also serves as a placeholder for future inclusion of machine automatable courses of action.

=== Grouping

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#grouping#

A Grouping object explicitly asserts that the referenced STIX Objects have a shared context, unlike a STIX Bundle (which explicitly conveys no context).
A Grouping object should not be confused with an intelligence product, which should be conveyed via a STIX Report.

A STIX Grouping object might represent a set of data that, in time, given sufficient analysis, would mature to convey an incident or threat report as a STIX Report object.
For example, a Grouping could be used to characterize an ongoing investigation into a security event or incident.
A Grouping object could also be used to assert that the referenced STIX Objects are related to an ongoing analysis process, such as when a threat analyst is collaborating with others in their trust community to examine a series of Campaigns and Indicators.
The Grouping SDO contains a list of references to SDOs, SCOs, SROs, and SMOs, along with an explicit statement of the context shared by the content, a textual description, and the name of the grouping.

=== Identity

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#identity#

Identities can represent actual individuals, organizations, or groups (e.g., ACME, Inc.) as well as classes of individuals, organizations, systems or groups (e.g., the finance sector).

The Identity SDO can capture basic identifying information, contact information, and the sectors that the Identity belongs to. Identity is used in STIX to represent, among other things, targets of attacks, information sources, object creators, and threat actor identities.

=== Indicator

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#indicator#

Indicators contain a pattern that can be used to detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
For example, an Indicator may be used to represent a set of malicious domains and use the STIX Patterning Language (see <<_stix_patterning_2>>) to specify these domains.

The Indicator SDO contains a simple textual description, the Kill Chain Phases that it detects behavior in, a time window for when the Indicator is valid or useful, and a required *pattern* property to capture a structured detection pattern.
Conforming STIX implementations *MUST* support the STIX Patterning Language as defined in <<_stix_patterning_2>>.

Relationships from the Indicator can describe the malicious or suspicious behavior that it directly detects (Malware, Tool, and Attack Pattern). In addition, it may also imply the presence of a Campaigns, Intrusion Sets, and Threat Actors, etc.

=== Intrusion Set

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#intrusion-set#

An Intrusion Set is a grouped set of adversarial behaviors and resources with common properties that is believed to be orchestrated by a single organization.
An Intrusion Set may capture multiple Campaigns or other activities that are all tied together by shared attributes indicating a commonly known or unknown Threat Actor.
New activity can be attributed to an Intrusion Set even if the Threat Actors behind the attack are not known.
Threat Actors can move from supporting one Intrusion Set to supporting another, or they may support multiple Intrusion Sets.

Where a Campaign is a set of attacks over a period of time against a specific set of targets to achieve some objective, an Intrusion Set is the entire attack package and may be used over a very long period of time in multiple Campaigns to achieve potentially multiple purposes.

While sometimes an Intrusion Set is not active, or changes focus, it is usually difficult to know if it has truly disappeared or ended.
Analysts may have varying level of fidelity on attributing an Intrusion Set back to Threat Actors.

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set#
|[stixliteral]#attributed-to#
|[stixtype]#threat-actor#
|This Relationship describes that the related Threat Actor is involved in carrying out the Intrusion Set.

For example, an [stixliteral]#attributed-to# Relationship from the Red Orca Intrusion Set to the Urban Fowl Threat Actor means that the actor carried out or was involved in some of the activity described by the Intrusion Set.

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set# 
|[stixliteral]#compromises#
|[stixtype]#infrastructure# 
|This Relationship describes that the Intrusion Set compromises the related Infrastructure.

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set# 
|[stixliteral]#hosts#, [stixliteral]#owns#
|[stixtype]#infrastructure# 
|This Relationship describes that the Intrusion Set hosts or owns the related Infrastructure (e.g. an actor that rents botnets to other threat actors).

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set# 
|[stixliteral]#originates-from#
|[stixtype]#location#
|This Relationship describes that the Intrusion Set originates from the related location and *SHOULD NOT* be used to define attribution.

For example, an [stixliteral]#originates-from# relationship from the Red Orca Intrusion Set to a Location representing North America means that the Red Orca Intrusion Set appears to originate from or is located in North America.

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set# 
|[stixliteral]#targets# 
|[stixtype]#identity#, [stixtype]#location#, [stixtype]#vulnerability#
|This Relationship describes that the Intrusion Set uses exploits of the related Vulnerability or targets the type of victims described by the related Identity or Location.

For example, a [stixliteral]#targets# Relationship from the Red Orca Intrusion Set to a Vulnerability in a blogging platform indicates that attacks performed as part of Red Orca often exploit that Vulnerability.

Similarly, a [stixliteral]#targets# Relationship from the Red Orca Intrusion Set to an Identity describing the energy sector in the United States means that the Intrusion Set typically carries out attacks against targets in that sector.

|[stixtype]#intrusion-set# 
|[stixliteral]#uses# 
|[stixtype]#attack-pattern#, [stixtype]#infrastructure#, [stixtype]#malware#, [stixtype]#tool#
|This Relationship describes that attacks carried out as part of the Intrusion Set typically use the related Attack Pattern, Infrastructure, Malware, or Tool.

For example, a [stixliteral]#uses# Relationship from the Red Orca Intrusion Set to the xInject Malware indicates that xInject is often used during attacks attributed to that Intrusion Set.

=== Location

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#location#

A Location represents a geographic location.
The location may be described as any, some or all of the following: region (e.g., North America), civic address (e.g. New York, US), latitude and longitude.

Locations are primarily used to give context to other SDOs.
For example, a Location could be used in a relationship to describe that the Bourgeois Swallow intrusion set originates from Eastern Europe.

The Location SDO can be related to an Identity or Intrusion Set to indicate that the identity or intrusion set is located in that location.
It can also be related from a malware or attack pattern to indicate that they target victims in that location.
The Location object describes geographic areas, not governments, even in cases where that area might have a government.
For example, a Location representing the United States describes the United States as a geographic area, not the federal government of the United States.

At least one of the following properties/sets of properties *MUST* be provided:

* *region*
* *country*
* *latitude* and *longitude*

When a combination of properties is provided (e.g. a *region* and a *latitude* and *longitude*) the more precise properties are what the location describes.
In other words, if a location contains both a region of [stixliteral]#northern-america# and a country of [stixliteral]#us#, then the location describes the United States, not all of North America. In cases where a latitude and longitude are specified without a precision, the location describes the most precise other value.

If precision is specified, then the datum for *latitude* and *longitude* *MUST* be WGS 84 <<WGS84>>.
Organizations specifying a designated location using *latitude* and *longitude* *SHOULD* specify the precision which is appropriate for the scope of the location being identified.
The scope is defined by the boundary as outlined by the precision around the coordinates.

=== Malware

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#malware#

Malware is a type of TTP that represents malicious code.
It generally refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly.
The intent is to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system (OS) or otherwise annoy or disrupt the victim.

The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware instances and families from data that may be derived from analysis.
This SDO captures detailed information about how the malware works and what it does.
This SDO captures contextual data relevant to sharing Malware data without requiring the full analysis provided by the Malware Analysis SDO.

The Indicator SDO provides intelligence producers with the ability to define, using the STIX Pattern Grammar in a standard way to identify and detect behaviors associated with malicious activities.
Although the Malware SDO provides vital intelligence on a specific instance or malware family, it does not provide a standard grammar that the Indicator SDO provides to identify those properties in security detection systems designed to process the STIX Pattern grammar.
We strongly encourage the use of STIX Indicators for the detection of actual malware, due to its use of the STIX Patterning language and the clear semantics that it provides.

To minimize the risk of a consumer compromising their system in parsing malware samples, producers *SHOULD* consider sharing defanged content (archive and password-protected samples) instead of raw, base64-encoded malware samples.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#authored-by#
|[stixtype]#threat-actor#, [stixtype]#intrusion-set#
|This Relationship describes that the malware instance or family was developed by the related threat actor or intrusion set.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#beacons-to#, [stixliteral]#exfiltrates-to#
|[stixtype]#infrastructure#
|This Relationship describes that the malware instance or family beacons to or exfiltrates data to the related Infrastructure.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#communicates-with#
|[stixtype]#ipv4-addr#, [stixtype]#ipv6-addr#, [stixtype]#domain-name#, [stixtype]#url#
|This Relationship documents that this malware instance (or family) communicates with (beacons to, connects to, or exfiltrated data to) the defined network addressable resource.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#controls#
|[stixtype]#malware# 
|This Relationship documents that this malware instance (or family) can control other malware which may be resident on the same system on which it is executing.

Note that this is not meant to imply or state that the malware instance or family drops other malware (which is covered by the [stixliteral]#drops# relationship).
Rather, it is meant to state that the malware instance or family is able to subvert or control other malware to achieve its goals.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#downloads#, [stixliteral]#drops#
|[stixtype]#malware#, [stixtype]#tool#, [stixtype]#file#
|These Relationships document that this malware instance (or family) downloads or drops another malware instance, tool or file. This is especially common with "first-stage" malware instances such as downloaders and droppers.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#exploits#
|[stixtype]#vulnerability#
|This Relationship documents that this malware instance or family exploits or attempts to exploit a particular vulnerability.

For example, an [stixliteral]#exploits# Relationship linking a malware instance or family representing a downloader to a Vulnerability for CVE-2016-0001 means that the malware instance or family exploits that vulnerability.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#originates-from#
|[stixtype]#location#
|This Relationship documents that this malware instance or family originates from a particular location.

|[stixtype]#malware# 
|[stixliteral]#targets#
|[stixtype]#identity#, [stixtype]#infrastructure#, [stixtype]#location#, [stixtype]#vulnerability#
|This Relationship documents that a malware instance or family is being used to target an Identity, Infrastructure, or Location. For malware families, this can be used to capture the full set of identities, infrastructures, or locations targeted by the family.

Similarly, a [stixliteral]#targets# Relationship linking a malware instance or family representing a downloader to an Identity representing the energy sector means that downloader is typically used against targets in the energy sector.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#uses#
|[stixtype]#attack-pattern#, [stixtype]#infrastructure#, [stixtype]#malware#, [stixtype]#tool#
|This Relationship documents that this malware instance or family uses the attack pattern, infrastructure, malware, or tool to achieve its objectives.

For example, a [stixliteral]#uses# Relationship from the jay-sm17h Threat Actor to the xInject Malware indicates that xInject is often used by jay-sm17h.

|[stixtype]#malware#
|[stixliteral]#variant-of#
|[stixtype]#malware#
|This Relationship is used to document that one malware instance or family is a variant of another malware instance or family.

Only the following uses of this relationship are valid:

Malware instance → Malware family: a Malware instance is a variant of a Malware family.
For example, a particular Zeus version 2 sample is a variant of the broader Zeus family.

Malware family → Malware family: a Malware family is a variant of another Malware family.
For example, the Gameover Zeus family is a variant of the broader Zeus family.

Malware instance → Malware instance: a Malware instance is a variant of another Malware instance.
For example, a particular Cryptolocker instance that is based on an another Cryptolocker instance with minor changes.

Malware family → Malware instance: this relationship *MUST NOT* be used as it is not semantically valid.

=== Note

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#note#

A Note is intended to convey informative text to provide further context and/or to provide additional analysis not contained in the STIX Objects, Marking Definition objects, or Language Content objects which the Note relates to.
Notes can be created by anyone (not just the original object creator).

For example, an analyst may add a Note to a Campaign object created by another organization indicating that they've seen posts related to that Campaign on a hacker forum.

Because Notes are typically (though not always) created by human analysts and are comprised of human-oriented text, they contain an additional property to capture the analyst(s) that created the Note.
This is distinct from the *created_by_ref* property, which is meant to capture the organization that created the object.

--------------------------------------
=== Observed Data

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#observed-data#

Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs).
For example, Observed Data can capture information about an IP address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key.
Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply the raw information without any context for what it means.

Observed Data can capture that a piece of information was seen one or more times.
Meaning, it can capture both a single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) as well as the aggregation of multiple observations of an entity.
When the *number_observed* property is 1 the Observed Data represents a single entity.
When the *number_observed* property is greater than 1, the Observed Data represents several instances of an entity potentially collected over a period of time.
If a time window is known, that can be captured using the *first_observed* and *last_observed* properties.
When used to collect aggregate data, it is likely that some properties in the SCO (e.g., timestamp properties) will be omitted because they would differ for each of the individual observations.

Observed Data may be used by itself (without relationships) to convey raw data collected from any source including analyst reports, sandboxes, and network and host-based detection tools.
An intelligence producer conveying Observed Data *SHOULD* include as much context (e.g. SCOs) as possible that supports the use of the observed data set in systems expecting to utilize the Observed Data for improved security.
This includes all SCOs that matched on an Indicator pattern and are represented in the collected observed event (or events) being conveyed in the Observed Data object.
For example, a firewall could emit a single Observed Data instance containing a single Network Traffic object for each connection it sees.
The firewall could also aggregate data and instead send out an Observed Data instance every ten minutes with an IP address and an appropriate *number_observed* value to indicate the number of times that IP address was observed in that window.
A sandbox could emit an Observed Data instance containing a file hash that it discovered.

Observed Data may also be related to other SDOs to represent raw data that is relevant to those objects.
For example, the Sighting Relationship object, can relate an Indicator, Malware, or other SDO to a specific Observed Data to represent the raw information that led to the creation of the Sighting (e.g., what was actually seen that suggested that a particular instance of malware was active).

To support backwards compatibility, related SCOs can still be specified using the *objects* properties, either the *objects* property or the *object_refs* property *MUST* be provided, but both *MUST NOT* be present at the same time.

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#observed-data#.

|*first_observed* (required)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The beginning of the time window during which the data was seen.

|*last_observed* (required)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The end of the time window during which the data was seen.

This *MUST* be greater than or equal to the timestamp in the *first_observed* property.

|*number_observed* (required)
|[stixtype]#integer#
|The number of times that each Cyber-observable object represented in the *objects* or *object_ref* property was seen.
If present, this *MUST* be an integer between 1 and 999,999,999 inclusive.

If the *number_observed* property is greater than 1, the data contained in the *objects* or *object_refs* property was seen multiple times.
In these cases, object creators *MAY* omit properties of the SCO (such as timestamps) that are specific to a single instance of that observed data.

|*objects* (optional - deprecated)
|[stixtype]#observable-container#
|A dictionary of SCO representing the observation. The dictionary *MUST* contain at least one object.

The cyber observable content *MAY* include multiple objects if those objects are related as part of a single observation. Multiple objects not related to each other via cyber observable Relationships *MUST NOT* be contained within the same Observed Data instance.

This property *MUST NOT* be present if *object_refs* is provided.

For example, a Network Traffic object and two IPv4 Address objects related via the *src_ref* and *dst_ref* properties can be contained in the same Observed Data because they are all related and used to characterize that single entity.

NOTE: this property is now deprecated in favor of object_refs and will be removed in a future version.

|*object_refs* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#
|A list of SCOs and SROs representing the observation. The *object_refs* *MUST* contain at least one SCO reference if defined.

The *object_refs* *MAY* include multiple SCOs and their corresponding SROs, if those SCOs are related as part of a single observation.

For example, a Network Traffic object and two IPv4 Address objects related via the *src_ref* and *dst_ref* properties can be contained in the same Observed Data because they are all related and used to characterize that single entity.

This property *MUST NOT* be present if *objects* is provided.

==== Relationships

There are no forward relationships explicitly defined between the Observed Data object and other STIX Objects, other than those defined as common relationships.
The first section lists the embedded relationships by property name along with their corresponding target.
The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships targeting this object type from another object type.
They are included here for convenience.
For their definitions, please see the "Source" object.

In addition to the relationships created using the generic Relationship object, Observed Data is also a direct target of the Sighting SRO.
Sightings represent a relationship between some intelligence entity that was seen (e.g., an Indicator or Malware instance), where it was seen, and what evidence was actually seen. The evidence (or raw data) in that relationship is captured as Observed Data.

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below.
Relationships can be created between any objects using the [stixliteral]#related-to# relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.

=== Opinion

*Type Name*: [stixtype]#opinion#

An Opinion is an assessment of the correctness of the information in a STIX Object produced by a different entity.
The primary property is the *opinion* property, which captures the level of agreement or disagreement using a fixed scale.
That fixed scale also supports a numeric mapping to allow for consistent statistical operations across opinions.

For example, an analyst from a consuming organization might say that they "strongly disagree" with a Campaign object and provide an explanation about why.
In a more automated workflow, a SOC operator might give an Indicator "one star" in their TIP (expressing "strongly disagree") because it is considered to be a false positive within their environment.
Opinions are subjective, and the specification does not address how best to interpret them.
Sharing communities are encouraged to provide clear guidelines to their constituents regarding best practice for the use of Opinion objects within the community.

Because Opinions are typically (though not always) created by human analysts and are comprised of human-oriented text, they contain an additional property to capture the analyst(s) that created the Opinion.
This is distinct from the *created_by_ref* property, which is meant to capture the organization that created the object.

=== Report

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#report#

Reports are collections of threat intelligence focused on one or more topics, such as a description of a threat actor, malware, or attack technique, including context and related details.
They are used to group related threat intelligence together so that it can be published as a comprehensive cyber threat story.

The Report SDO contains a list of references to STIX Objects (the CTI objects included in the report) along with a textual description and the name of the report.

For example, a threat report produced by ACME Defense Corp. discussing the Glass Gazelle campaign should be represented using Report.
The Report itself would contain the narrative of the report while the Campaign SDO and any related SDOs (e.g., Indicators for the Campaign, Malware it uses, and the associated Relationships) would be referenced in the report contents.

=== Threat Actor

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#threat-actor#

Threat Actors are actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent.
A Threat Actor is not an Intrusion Set but may support or be affiliated with various Intrusion Sets, groups, or organizations over time.

Threat Actors leverage their resources, and possibly the resources of an Intrusion Set, to conduct attacks and run Campaigns against targets.

Threat Actors can be characterized by their motives, capabilities, goals, sophistication level, past activities, resources they have access to, and their role in the organization.

|A list of other names that this Threat Actor is believed to use.

|*first_seen* (optional) 
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The time that this Threat Actor was first seen.

This property is a summary property of data from sightings and other data that may or may not be available in STIX.
If new sightings are received that are earlier than the first seen timestamp, the object may be updated to account for the new data.

|*last_seen* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The time that this Threat Actor was last seen.

This property is a summary property of data from sightings and other data that may or may not be available in STIX.
If new sightings are received that are later than the last seen timestamp, the object may be updated to account for the new data.

If this property and the *first_seen* property are both defined, then this property *MUST* be greater than or equal to the timestamp in the *first_seen* property.

|*roles* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#open-vocab#
|A list of roles the Threat Actor plays.

The values for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_threat_actor_role_vocabulary,threat-actor-role-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*goals* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#string#
|The high-level goals of this Threat Actor, namely, _what_ are they trying to do.
For example, they may be motivated by personal gain, but their goal is to steal credit card numbers.
To do this, they may execute specific Campaigns that have detailed objectives like compromising point of sale systems at a large retailer.

|*sophistication* (optional)
|[stixtype]#open-vocab#
|The skill, specific knowledge, special training, or expertise a Threat Actor must have to perform the attack.

The value for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_threat_actor_sophistication_vocabulary,threat-actor-sophistication-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*resource_level* (optional)
|[stixtype]#open-vocab#
|The organizational level at which this Threat Actor typically works, which in turn determines the resources available to this Threat Actor for use in an attack.
This attribute is linked to the *sophistication* property — a specific resource level implies that the Threat Actor has access to at least a specific sophistication level.

The value for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_attack_resource_level_vocabulary,attack-resource-level-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*primary_motivation* (optional)
|[stixtype]#open-vocab#
|The primary reason, motivation, or purpose behind this Threat Actor.
The motivation is _why_ the Threat Actor wishes to achieve the goal (what they are trying to achieve).

The value for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_attack_motivation_vocabulary,attack-motivation-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*secondary_motivations* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#open-vocab#
|This property specifies the secondary reasons, motivations, or purposes behind this Threat Actor.

These motivations can exist as an equal or near-equal cause to the primary motivation.
However, it does not replace or necessarily magnify the primary motivation, but it might indicate additional context.
The position in the list has no significance.

The value for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_attack_motivation_vocabulary,attack-motivation-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*personal_motivations* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#open-vocab#
|The personal reasons, motivations, or purposes of the Threat Actor regardless of organizational goals.

Personal motivation, which is independent of the organization's goals, describes what impels an individual to carry out an attack.
Personal motivation may align with the organization's motivation — as is common with activists — but more often it supports personal goals.
For example, an individual analyst may join a Data Miner corporation because his or her skills may align with the corporation's objectives.
But the analyst most likely performs his or her daily work toward those objectives for personal reward in the form of a paycheck.
The motivation of personal reward may be even stronger for Threat Actors who commit illegal acts, as it is more difficult for someone to cross that line purely for altruistic reasons.
The position in the list has no significance.

The values for this property *SHOULD* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_attack_motivation_vocabulary,attack-motivation-ov>># open vocabulary.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor# 
|[stixliteral]#attributed-to#
|[stixtype]#identity# 
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor's real identity is the related Identity.

For example, an [stixliteral]#attributed-to# Relationship from the jay-sm17h Threat Actor to the John Smith Identity means that the actor known as jay-sm17h is John Smith.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor# 
|[stixliteral]#compromises#
|[stixtype]#infrastructure# 
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor compromises the related Infrastructure.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor#
|[stixliteral]#hosts#, [stixliteral]#owns#
|[stixtype]#infrastructure#
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor hosts or owns the related Infrastructure (e.g. an actor that rents botnets to other threat actors).

|[stixtype]#threat-actor#
|[stixliteral]#impersonates#
|[stixtype]#identity#
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor impersonates the related Identity.

For example, an [stixliteral]#impersonates# Relationship from the gh0st Threat Actor to the ACME Corp. Identity means that the actor known as gh0st impersonates ACME Corp.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor#
|[stixliteral]#located-at#
|[stixtype]#location#
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor is located at or in the related Location.

For example, a [stixliteral]#located-at# relationship from the gh0st Threat Actor to a Location representing the United States means that ACME Corporation is located in the United States.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor#
|[stixliteral]#targets#
|[stixtype]#identity#, [stixtype]#location#, [stixtype]#vulnerability#
|This Relationship describes that the Threat Actor uses exploits of the related Vulnerability or targets the type of victims described by the related Identity or Location.

For example, a [stixliteral]#targets# Relationship from the jay-sm17h Threat Actor to a Vulnerability in a blogging platform indicates that attacks performed by John Smith often exploit that Vulnerability.

Similarly, a [stixliteral]#targets# Relationship from the jay-sm17h Threat Actor to an Identity describing the energy sector in the United States means that John Smith often carries out attacks against targets in that sector.

|[stixtype]#threat-actor# 
|[stixliteral]#uses# 
|[stixtype]#attack-pattern#, [stixtype]#infrastructure#, [stixtype]#malware#, [stixtype]#tool#
|This Relationship describes that attacks carried out as part of the Threat Actor typically use the related Attack Pattern, Infrastructure, Malware, or Tool.

For example, a [stixliteral]#uses# Relationship from the jay-sm17h Threat Actor to the xInject Malware indicates that xInject is often used by John Smith.

A campaign, threat actor, intrusion set, malware, or tool takes infrastructure and compromises and/or uses it for their own.

=== Tool

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#tool#

Tools are legitimate software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks.
Knowing how and when threat actors use such tools can be important for understanding how campaigns are executed.
Unlike malware, these tools or software packages are often found on a system and have legitimate purposes for power users, system administrators, network administrators, or even normal users.
Remote access tools (e.g., RDP) and network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) are examples of Tools that may be used by a Threat Actor during an attack.

The Tool SDO characterizes the properties of these software tools and can be used as a basis for making an assertion about how a Threat Actor uses them during an attack.
It contains properties to name and describe the tool, a list of Kill Chain Phases the tool can be used to carry out, and the version of the tool.

This SDO *MUST NOT* be used to characterize malware.
Further, Tool *MUST NOT* be used to characterize tools used as part of a course of action in response to an attack.

=== Vulnerability

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#vulnerability#

A Vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or implementations of the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and some hardware components (e.g., firmware) that can be directly exploited to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that system.

CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that provides common names for publicly known problems <<CVE>>.
For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.

The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an external definition.
Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity.
As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance process.

--------------------------------------
== STIX Relationship Objects ==

STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) represent types of relationships used to describe CTI.
The Generic Relationship SRO is used to describe many varied types of relationships, while the specific Sighting SRO contains additional properties to represent Sighting relationships.

Property information, relationship information, and examples are provided for each SRO defined below.
Property information includes common properties as well as properties that are specific to each SRO.
Because SROs cannot be the source or target of other SROs, relationship information is included but only to describe embedded relationships (e.g., *created_by_ref*).

=== Relationship

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#relationship#

The Relationship object is used to link together two SDOs or SCOs in order to describe how they are related to each other.
If SDOs and SCOs are considered "nodes" or "vertices" in the graph, the Relationship Objects (SROs) represent "edges".

STIX defines many relationship types to link together SDOs and SCOs.
These relationships are contained in the "Relationships" table under each SDO and SCO definition.
Relationship types defined in the specification *SHOULD* be used to ensure consistency.
An example of a specification-defined relationship is that an [stixtype]#indicator# [stixliteral]#indicates# a [stixtype]#campaign#.
That relationship type is listed in the Relationships section of the Indicator SDO definition.

STIX also allows relationships from any SDO or SCO to any SDO or SCO that have not been defined in this specification.
These relationships *MAY* use the [stixliteral]#related-to# relationship type or *MAY* use a user-defined relationship type.
As an example, a user might want to link [stixtype]#malware# directly to a [stixtype]#tool#.
They can do so using [stixliteral]#related-to# to say that the Malware is related to the Tool but not describe how, or they could use [stixliteral]#delivered-by# (a user-defined name they determined) to indicate more detail.

Note that some relationships in STIX may seem like "shortcuts".
For example, an Indicator doesn't really detect a Campaign: it detects activity (Attack Patterns, Malware, Infrastructure, etc.) that are often used by that campaign.
While some analysts might want all of the source data and think that shortcuts are misleading, in many cases it's helpful to provide just the key points (shortcuts) and leave out the low-level details.
In other cases, the low-level analysis may not be known or sharable, while the high-level analysis is.
For these reasons, relationships that might appear to be "shortcuts" are not excluded from STIX.

==== Specification-Defined Relationships Summary

A relationship summary table for all specification-defined relationships can be found in <<_relationship_summary_table>> of this document.
The relationship summary table is provided as a convenience.
If there is a discrepancy between the table and the relationships defined with each of the SDOs, then the relationships defined with the SDOs *MUST* be viewed as authoritative.​

This value *SHOULD* be an exact value listed in the relationships for the source and target SDO, but *MAY* be any string.
The value of this property *MUST* be in ASCII and is limited to characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and hyphen (-).

|*description* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|A description that provides more details and context about the Relationship, potentially including its purpose and its key characteristics.

|*source_ref* (required)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *id* of the source (from) object. The value *MUST* be an ID reference to an SDO or SCO (i.e., it cannot point to an SRO, Bundle, Language Content, or Marking Definition).

|*target_ref* (required)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *id* of the target (to) object. The value *MUST* be an ID reference to an SDO or SCO (i.e., it cannot point to an SRO, Bundle, Language Content, or Marking Definition).

|*start_time* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|This optional timestamp represents the earliest time at which the Relationship between the objects exists.
If this property is a future timestamp, at the time the *start_time* property is defined, then this represents an estimate by the producer of the intelligence of the earliest time at which relationship will be asserted to be true.

If it is not specified, then the earliest time at which the relationship between the objects exists is not defined.

|*stop_time* (optional) 
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The latest time at which the Relationship between the objects exists.
If this property is a future timestamp, at the time the *stop_time* property is defined, then this represents an estimate by the producer of the intelligence of the latest time at which relationship will be asserted to be true.

If *start_time* and *stop_time* are both defined, then *stop_time* *MUST* be later than the *start_time* value.

If *stop_time* is not specified, then the latest time at which the relationship between the objects exists is either not known, not disclosed, or has no defined stop time.

|===

==== Relationships

There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Relationship object and other STIX Objects, other than the embedded relationships listed below. These embedded relationships are listed by property name along with their corresponding target.

The only type of relationship that can point to a Relationship Object is the embedded relationship on the Note, Opinion, and Language Content Objects.

=== Sighting

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#sighting#

A Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen.
Sightings are used to track who and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track trends in attack behavior.

The Sighting relationship object is a special type of SRO; it is a relationship that contains extra properties not present on the Generic Relationship object.
These extra properties are included to represent data specific to sighting relationships (e.g., *count*, representing how many times something was seen), but for other purposes a Sighting can be thought of as a Relationship with a name of "sighting-of".
Sighting is captured as a relationship because you cannot have a sighting unless you have something that has been sighted.
Sighting does not make sense without the relationship to what was sighted.

Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:

* What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other SDO (*sighting_of_ref*)
* Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an Identity (*where_sighted_refs*)
* What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as Observed Data (*observed_data_refs*)

What was sighted is required; a sighting does not make sense unless you say what you saw.
Who sighted it, where it was sighted, and what was actually seen are optional.
In many cases it is not necessary to provide that level of detail in order to provide value.

Sightings are used whenever any SDO has been "seen".
In some cases, the object creator wishes to convey very little information about the sighting; the details might be sensitive, but the fact that they saw a malware instance or threat actor could still be very useful.
In other cases, providing the details may be helpful or even necessary; saying exactly which of the 1000 IP addresses in an indicator were sighted is helpful when tracking which of those IPs is still malicious.

Sighting is distinct from Observed Data in that Sighting is an intelligence assertion ("I saw this threat actor") while Observed Data is simply information ("I saw this file").
When you combine them by including the linked Observed Data (*observed_data_refs*) from a Sighting, you can say "I saw this file, and that makes me think I saw this threat actor".

|If present, this *MUST* be an integer between 0 and 999,999,999 inclusive and represents the number of times the SDO referenced by the *sighting_of_ref* property was sighted.

Observed Data has a similar property called *number_observed*, which refers to the number of times the data was observed.
These counts refer to different concepts and are distinct.

For example, a single sighting of a DDoS bot might have many millions of observations of the network traffic that it generates.
Thus, the Sighting *count* would be 1 (the bot was observed once) but the Observed Data *number_observed* would be much higher.

As another example, a sighting with a count of 0 can be used to express that an indicator was not seen at all.

|*sighting_of_ref* (required)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|An ID reference to the SDO that was sighted (e.g., Indicator or Malware).

For example, if this is a Sighting of an Indicator, that Indicator’s ID would be the value of this property.

This property *MUST* reference only an SDO.

|*observed_data_refs* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#
|A list of ID references to the Observed Data objects that contain the raw cyber data for this Sighting.

For example, a Sighting of an Indicator with an IP address could include the Observed Data for the network connection that the Indicator was used to detect.

This property *MUST* reference only Observed Data SDOs.

|*where_sighted_refs* (optional) 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#
|A list of ID references to the Identity or Location objects describing the entities or types of entities that saw the sighting.

Omitting the *where_sighted_refs* property does not imply that the sighting was seen by the object creator.
To indicate that the sighting was seen by the object creator, an Identity representing the object creator should be listed in *where_sighted_refs*.

This property *MUST* reference only Identity or Location SDOs.

|*summary* (optional)
|[stixtype]#boolean#
|The *summary* property indicates whether the Sighting should be considered summary data.
Summary data is an aggregation of previous Sightings reports and should not be considered primary source data. Default value is [stixliteral]#false#.

|===

==== Relationships

There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Sighting object and other STIX Objects, other than the embedded relationships listed below.
These embedded relationships are listed by property name along with their corresponding target.

The only type of relationship that can point to a Sighting Object is the embedded relationship on the Note, Opinion, and Language Content Objects.

|*mime_type* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|Whenever feasible, this value *SHOULD* be one of the values defined in the Template column in the IANA media type registry [<<MediaTypes>>].
Maintaining a comprehensive universal catalog of all extant file types is obviously not possible.
When specifying a MIME Type not included in the IANA registry, implementers should use their best judgement so as to facilitate interoperability.

|*payload_bin* (optional)
|[stixtype]#binary#
|Specifies the binary data contained in the artifact as a base64-encoded string.

This property *MUST NOT* be present if *url* is provided.

|*url* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The value of this property *MUST* be a valid URL that resolves to the unencoded content.

This property *MUST NOT* be present if *payload_bin* is provided.

|*hashes* (optional)
|[stixtype]#hashes#
|Specifies a dictionary of hashes for the contents of the *url* or the *payload_bin*.

This property *MUST* be present when the *url* property is present.

Dictionary keys *MUST* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_hashing_algorithm_vocabulary,hash-algorithm-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*encryption_algorithm* (optional)
|[stixtype]#enum#
|If the artifact is encrypted, specifies the type of encryption algorithm the binary data (either via *payload_bin* or *url*) is encoded in.

The value of this property *MUST* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_encryption_algorithm_enumeration,encryption-algorithm-enum>># enumeration.

If both *mime_type* and *encryption_algorithm* are included, this signifies that the artifact represents an encrypted archive.

|*decryption_key* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|Specifies the decryption key for the encrypted binary data (either via *payload_bin* or *url*).
For example, this may be useful in cases of sharing malware samples, which are often encoded in an encrypted archive.

=== File Object

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#file#

The File object represents the properties of a file.
A File object *MUST* contain at least one of *hashes* or *name*.

==== Properties 

[width="100%",stripes=odd,]
|===
|[stixtr]*Required Common Properties*
|*type*, *id*
|[stixtr]*Optional Common Properties*
|*spec_version*, *object_marking_refs*, *granular_markings*, *defanged*, *extensions*
|[stixtr]*Not Applicable Common Properties*
|*created_by_ref*, *revoked*, *labels*, *confidence*, *lang*, *external_references*
|[stixtr]*File Object Specific Properties*
|*hashes*, *size*, *name*, *name_enc*, *magic_number_hex*, *mime_type*, *ctime*, *mtime*, *atime*, *parent_directory_ref*, *contains_refs*, *content_ref*
|[stixtr]*ID Contributing Properties*
|*hashes*, *name*, *extensions*, *parent_directory_ref*

If the *hashes* property is present, include only one hash. The selected hash *SHOULD* come from this ordered list (based on the following order of preference) [ MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 ].

|===
[width="100%",cols="27%,15%,58%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#file#.

|*extensions* (optional) 
|[stixtype]#dictionary#
|The File object defines the following extensions. In addition to these, producers *MAY* create their own.

[stixtype]#ntfs-ext#, [stixtype]#raster-image-ext#, [stixtype]#pdf-ext#, [stixtype]#archive-ext#, [stixtype]#windows-pebinary-ext#

Dictionary keys *MUST* use the specification defined name (examples above) or be the id of a STIX Extension object, depending on the type of extension being used.

The corresponding dictionary values *MUST* contain the contents of the extension instance.

|*hashes* (optional)
|[stixtype]#hashes#
|Specifies a dictionary of hashes for the file.

(When used with the Archive File Extension, this refers to the hash of the *entire* archive file, *not* its contents.)

Dictionary keys *MUST* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_hashing_algorithm_vocabulary,hash-algorithm-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*size* (optional)
|[stixtype]#integer#
|Specifies the size of the file, in bytes. The value of this property *MUST NOT* be negative.

|*name* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|Specifies the name of the file.

|*name_enc* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|Specifies the observed encoding for the name of the file.
This value *MUST* be specified using the corresponding name from the 2013-12-20 revision of the IANA character set registry <<CharacterSets>>.
If the value from the Preferred MIME Name column for a character set is defined, this value *MUST* be used; if it is not defined, then the value from the Name column in the registry *MUST* be used instead.

This property allows for the capture of the original text encoding for the file name, which may be forensically relevant; for example, a file on an NTFS volume whose name was created using the windows-1251 encoding, commonly used for languages based on Cyrillic script.

|*magic_number_hex* (optional)
|[stixtype]#hex#
|Specifies the hexadecimal constant ("magic number") associated with a specific file format that corresponds to the file, if applicable.

|*mime_type* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|Specifies the MIME type name specified for the file, e.g., [stixliteral]#application/msword#.

Whenever feasible, this value *SHOULD* be one of the values defined in the Template column in the IANA media type registry [<<MediaTypes>>].

Maintaining a comprehensive universal catalog of all extant file types is obviously not possible. When specifying a MIME Type not included in the IANA registry, implementers should use their best judgement so as to facilitate interoperability.

|*ctime* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|Specifies the date/time the file was created.

|*mtime* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|Specifies the date/time the file was last written to/modified.

|*atime* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|Specifies the date/time the file was last accessed.

|*parent_directory_ref* (optional)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|Specifies the parent directory of the file, as a reference to a Directory object.

The object referenced in this property *MUST* be of type [stixtype]#directory#.

|*contains_refs* (optional)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#
|Specifies a list of references to other Cyber-observable Objects contained within the file, such as another file that is appended to the end of the file, or an IP address that is contained somewhere in the file.

This is intended for use cases other than those targeted by the Archive extension.

|*content_ref* (optional)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|Specifies the content of the file, represented as an Artifact object.

The object referenced in this property *MUST* be of type [stixtype]#artifact#.

The port value *MUST* be in the range of 0 - 65535.

|*protocols* (required)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#string#
a|Specifies the protocols observed in the network traffic, along with their corresponding state.

Protocols *MUST* be listed in low to high order, from outer to inner in terms of packet encapsulation.
That is, the protocols in the outer level of the packet, such as IP, *MUST* be listed first.

The protocol names *SHOULD* come from the service names defined in the Service Name column of the IANA Service Name and Port Number Registry [<<PortNumbers>>].
In cases where there is variance in the name of a network protocol not included in the IANA Registry, content producers should exercise their best judgement, and it is recommended that lowercase names be used for consistency with the IANA registry.

If the protocol extension is present, the corresponding protocol value for that extension *SHOULD* be listed in this property.

==== X.509 v3 Extensions Type

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#x509-v3-extensions-type#

The X.509 v3 Extensions type captures properties associated with X.509 v3 extensions, which serve as a mechanism for specifying additional information such as alternative subject names.
An object using the X.509 v3 Extensions type *MUST* contain at least one property from this type.

Note that the use of the term "extensions" in this context refers to the X.509 v3 Extensions type and is not a STIX Cyber Observables extension.
Therefore, it is a type that describes X.509 extensions.

== STIX Meta Objects

=== Language Content

The Language Content object represents text content for STIX Objects represented in languages other than that of the original object. Language content may be a translation of the original object by a third-party, a first-source translation by the original publisher, or additional official language content provided at the time of creation.

Language Content contains two important sets of properties:

* The *object_ref* and *object_modified* properties specify the target object that the language content applies to.
** For example, to provide additional language content for a Campaign, the *object_ref* property should be set to the *id* of the Campaign and the *object_modified* property set to its modified time. Most relationships in STIX are not specific to a particular version of a STIX object, but because language content provides the translation of specific text, the *object_modified* property is necessary to provide that specificity.
* The *content* property is a [stixtype]#dictionary# which maps to properties in the target object in order to provide a translation of them.

==== Properties

[width="100%",stripes=odd,]

|[stixtr]*Language Content Specific Properties*
|*object_ref*, *object_modified*, *contents*
|===
[width="100%",cols="32%,28%,40%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *type* property identifies the type of object.
The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#language-content#.

|*object_ref* (required)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *object_ref* property identifies the *id* of the object that this Language Content applies to.
It *MUST* be the identifier for a STIX Object.

|*object_modified* (optional)
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
|The *object_modified* property identifies the *modified* time of the object that this Language Content applies to.
It *MUST* be an exact match for the *modified* time of the STIX Object being referenced.

|*contents* (required)
|[stixtype]#dictionary#
a|
The *contents* property contains the actual Language Content (translation).

The keys in the dictionary *MUST* be RFC 5646 language codes for which language content is being provided <<RFC5646>>.
The values each consist of a dictionary that mirrors the properties in the target object (identified by *object_ref* and *object_modified*).
For example, to provide a translation of the *name* property on the target object the key in the dictionary would be *name*.

For each key in the nested dictionary:

* If the original property is a [stixtype]#string#, the corresponding property in the language content object *MUST* contain a string with the content for that property in the language of the top-level key.
* If the original property is a [stixtype]#list#, the corresponding property in the translation object must also be a [stixtype]#list#.
Each item in this list recursively maps to the item at the same position in the list contained in the target object. The lists *MUST* have the same length.
* In the event that translations are only provided for _some_ list items, the untranslated list items *MUST* be represented by an empty string ("").
This indicates to a consumer of the Language Content object that they should interpolate the translated list items in the Language Content object with the corresponding (untranslated) list items from the original object as indicated by the *object_ref* property.
* If the original property is an object (including dictionaries), the corresponding location in the translation object must also be an object.
Each key/value field in this object recursively maps to the object with the same key in the original.

The translation object *MAY* contain only a subset of the translatable fields of the original.
Keys that point to non-translatable properties in the target or to properties that do not exist in the target object *MUST* be ignored.

|===

==== Relationships

There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Language Content object and other STIX Objects, other than the embedded relationships listed below.
These embedded relationships are listed by property name along with their corresponding target.

Note that the *object_ref* relationship has a companion property, *object_modified*, that identifies the version of the object that the language content is being provided for.

=== Data Markings

Data markings represent restrictions, permissions, and other guidance for how data can be used and shared. 
For example, data may be shared with the restriction that it must not be re-shared, or that it must be encrypted at rest. 
In STIX, data markings are specified using the [stixtype]#marking-definition# object. 
These definitions are applied to complete STIX Objects using object markings and to individual properties of STIX Objects via granular markings.

Multiple markings can be added to the same object, including both object and granular markings. 
Some types of marking definitions or trust groups have rules about which markings override other markings or which markings can be additive to other markings.
This specification does not define rules for how multiple markings applied to the same object or property should be interpreted.

Granular data markings are also used to mark individual fields on an object with which language their text content is in.
For example, granular markings can be used to indicate that while the rest of the object is in English, the *description* field is in Japanese.
This mechanism does not use the marking-definition object to represent language, rather a separate *lang* field that can also be applied via granular markings.

==== Marking Definition

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#marking-definition#

The [stixtype]#marking-definition# object represents a specific marking.
Data markings typically represent handling or sharing requirements for data and are applied in the *object_marking_refs* and *granular_markings* properties on STIX Objects, which reference a list of IDs for [stixtype]#marking-definition# objects.

Two marking definition types are defined in this specification: TLP, to capture TLP markings, and Statement, to capture text marking statements.
In addition, it is expected that the FIRST Information Exchange Policy (IEP) will be included in a future version once a machine-usable specification for it has been defined.

Unlike other STIX Objects, Marking Definition objects cannot be versioned because it would allow for indirect changes to the markings on a STIX Object.
For example, if a Statement marking is changed from "Reuse Allowed" to "Reuse Prohibited", all STIX Objects marked with that Statement marking would effectively have an updated marking without being updated themselves.
Instead, a new Statement marking with the new text should be created and the marked objects updated to point to the new marking.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#marking-definition#.

The Statement marking type defines the representation of a textual marking statement (e.g., copyright, terms of use, etc.) in a definition.
The value of the *definition_type* property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#statement# when using this marking type.
Statement markings are generally not machine-readable, and this specification does not define any behavior or actions based on their values.

Content may be marked with multiple statements of use.
In other words, the same content can be marked both with a statement saying "Copyright 2019" and a statement saying, "Terms of use are ..." and both statements apply.

==== Object Markings

Object Markings apply data markings to an entire STIX Object and all of its contents.
Object Markings are specified as embedded relationships in the *object_marking_refs* property, which is an optional list of IDs for Marking Definition objects.
The referenced markings apply to that STIX Object or Marking Definition and all of its contents.
Changes to the *object_marking_refs* property (and therefore the markings applied to the object) are treated the same as changes to any other properties on the object and follow the same rules for versioning.


*Examples*

This example marks the Indicator and all its properties with the Marking Definition referenced by the ID.
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "indicator",
  "spec_version": "2.1",
  "id": "indicator--b346b4b3-f4b7-4235-b659-f985f65f0009",
  ...
  "object_marking_refs": ["marking-definition--34098fce-860f-48ae-8e50-ebd3cc5e41da"],
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

==== Granular Markings

Whereas object markings apply to an entire STIX Object or Marking Definition and all its properties, granular markings allow both data markings and language markings to be applied to individual portions of STIX Objects and Marking Definitions.
Granular markings are specified in the *granular_markings* property, which is a list of [stixtype]#granular-marking# instances.
Each of those instances contains a list of selectors to indicate what is marked and either a reference to the [stixtype]#marking-definition# object to be applied or a language code to be applied.
Granular markings can be used, for example, to indicate that the *name* property of an [stixtype]#indicator# should be handled as TLP:GREEN, the *description* property as TLP:AMBER, and the *pattern* property as TLP:RED.

The *granular_markings* property can also be used for language markings.
To support applying both data markings and language markings to an object, the [stixtype]#granular-marking# type has a choice of two properties in addition to the selector: the *lang* property is used to apply language markings, and the *marking_ref* property is used to apply data markings.
Because each granular marking instance applies to either a language or a marking, one and only one of these properties *MUST* be present on each instance of a granular marking.

===== Granular Marking Type

The [stixtype]#granular-marking# type defines how the [stixtype]#marking-definition# object referenced by the *marking_ref* property or a language specified by the *lang* property applies to a set of content identified by the list of selectors in the *selectors* property.

[width="100%",cols="27%,20%,53%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*lang* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *lang* property identifies the language of the text identified by this marking. The value of the *lang* property, if present, *MUST* be an <<RFC5646>> language code.

If the *marking_ref* property is not present, this property *MUST* be present.
If the *marking_ref* property is present, this property *MUST NOT* be present.

|*marking_ref* (optional)
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|The *marking_ref* property specifies the ID of the [stixtype]#marking-definition# object that describes the marking.

If the *lang* property is not present, this property *MUST* be present.
If the *lang* property is present, this property *MUST NOT* be present.

|*selectors*(required)
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#string#
|The *selectors* property specifies a list of selectors for content contained within the STIX Object in which this property appears.
Selectors *MUST* conform to the syntax defined below.

The [stixtype]#marking-definition# referenced in the *marking_ref* property is applied to the content selected by the selectors in this list.

The <<RFC5646>> language code specified by the *lang* property is applied to the content selected by the selectors in this list.

|===

​**Selector Syntax**

Selectors contained in the *selectors* list are strings that consist of multiple components that *MUST* be separated by the . character.
Each component *MUST* be one of:

* A property name or dictionary key, e.g., [stixliteral]#description#, or;
* A zero-based list index, specified as a non-negative integer in square brackets, e.g., [stixliteral]#[4]#

Selectors denote path traversals: the root of each selector is the STIX Object that the *granular_markings* property appears in.
Starting from that root, for each component in the selector, properties and list items are traversed.
When the complete list has been traversed, the value of the content is considered selected.

Selectors *MUST* refer to properties or list items that are actually present on the marked object.

As an example, consider the following STIX Object:
--------------------------------------
{
  "id": "vulnerability--ee916c28-c7a4-4d0d-ad56-a8d357f89fef",
  "spec_version": "2.1",
  "created": "2016-02-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "modified": "2016-02-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "type": "vulnerability",
  "name": "CVE-2014-0160",
  "description": "The (1) TLS...",
  "external_references": [
    {
      "source_name": "cve",
      "external_id": "CVE-2014-0160"
    }
  ],
  "labels": ["heartbleed", "has-logo"]
}
--------------------------------------

Valid selectors:

* [stixliteral]#description# selects the *description* property ("The (1) TLS...").
* [stixliteral]#external_references.[0].source_name# selects the *source_name* property of the first value of the *external_references* list ("cve").
* [stixliteral]#labels.[0]# selects the first item contained within the *labels* list ("heartbleed").
* [stixliteral]#labels# selects the list contained in the *labels* property.
Due to the recursive nature of the selector, that includes all items in the list (["heartbleed", "has-logo"]).
* [stixliteral]#external_references# selects the list contained in the *external_references* property.
Due to the recursive nature of the selector, that includes all list items and all properties of those list items.

Invalid selectors:

* [stixliteral]#pattern# and [stixliteral]#external_references.[3]# are invalid selectors because they refer to content not present in that object.
* [stixliteral]#description.[0]# is an invalid selector because the [stixliteral]#description# property is a string and not a list.
* [stixliteral]#labels.name# is an invalid selector because [stixliteral]#labels# property is a list and not an object.

This syntax is inspired by JSONPath [<<Goessner_2007>>] and is in fact a strict subset of allowable JSONPath expressions (with the exception that the '$' to indicate the root is implicit).
Care should be taken when passing selectors to JSONPath evaluators to ensure that the root of the query is the individual STIX Object.
It is expected, however, that selectors can be easily evaluated in programming languages that implement list and key/value mapping types (dictionaries, hashmaps, etc.) without resorting to an external library.

*Examples*

This example marks the *description* and *labels* properties with the [stixtype]#marking-definition# referenced in the *granular_markings* property however the *name* property uses the object marking.
--------------------------------------

  ...

=== Extension Definition

The STIX Extension Definition object allows producers of threat intelligence to extend existing STIX objects or to create entirely new STIX objects in a standardized way.
This object contains detailed information about the extension and any additional properties and or objects that it defines.
This extension mechanism *MUST NOT* be used to redefine existing standardized objects or properties.

If a producer does not include the STIX Extension Definition object with the STIX objects that use it, consumers should refer to <<_object_ids_and_references>> for information in resolving references.

There are three ways to extend STIX using STIX Extensions.

* Define one or more new STIX Object types.
* Define additional properties for an existing STIX Object type as a nested property extension.
This is typically done to represent a sub-component or module of one or more STIX Object types.
* Define additional properties for an existing STIX Object type at the object's top-level. This can be done to represent properties that form an inherent part of the definition of an object type.

When defining a new STIX Object (e.g., SDO, SCO, or SRO) all common properties associated with that type of object (SDO, SCO, SRO) *MUST* be included in the schema or definition of that new STIX Object type.
Extensions that create new STIX objects *MUST* follow all conformance requirements for that object type (SDO, SCO, SRO) including all of the requirements for the common properties associated with that object type.

When defining a STIX extension using the nested property extension mechanism the *extensions* property (as defined in <<_common_properties>>) *MUST* include the extension definition's UUID that defines the extension definition object and the *extension_type* property.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Producers using top-level property extensions should be mindful that another producer could also define a top-level property extension using the same property names but for different purposes causing name conflicts when both extensions are used in the same environment.
This standard does not define any name conflict resolution for new STIX Objects or for top-level properties created by this extension mechanism.
However, producers *SHOULD* follow industry best practices such as using unique property names that are guaranteed to avoid duplicates across all organizations to avoid naming conflicts.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Producers using STIX extensions should be mindful that future versions of the STIX specification *MAY* define objects and or properties that conflict with existing non-standardized extensions.
In these cases the meaning as defined in the STIX specification will override any and all conflicting extensions.

Specific extensions, as with specific Custom Properties, *MAY NOT* be supported across implementations.
A consumer that receives STIX content containing a STIX extension that it does not understand *MAY* refuse to process the content or *MAY* ignore that extension and continue processing the content.

The three uses of this extension facility *MAY* be combined into a single Extension Definition object when appropriate.

The following example highlights where this may be useful.

*Hybrid Extension Example*

An intelligence producer has a monitoring network of sensors that collect a variety of cybersecurity telemetry from each sensor where those sensors have unique data not currently defined in STIX 2.1.
The producer wishes to create an extension that other downstream consumers can receive both the high-level summarization object but also the individual categorized telemetry from each sensor.

* A new SDO representing the statistical summarization object.
* A list of new properties to be added to the standard Observed Data object representing additional meta-data information associated with the telemetry.
* A new SCO representing a new cyber observable data type.

In this case, the producer creates a single extension that contains the following extension types:
--------------------------------------
"extension_types": [ "new-sdo", "new-sco", "property-extension" ]
--------------------------------------
Therefore, producers *MAY* use the hybrid extension mechanism when they wish to define a single extension that encompasses new SDO and/or sub-component or top-level property extension properties in a related extension.

Producers *SHOULD NOT* use the hybrid extension mechanism if the extensions are not related to each other.
If the extensions are independent features then a producer *SHOULD* consider creating separate extension definitions.

==== Extension Definition Properties

[width="100%",stripes=odd,]
|===
|[stixtr]*Required Common Properties*
|*type*, *spec_version*, *id*, *created, modified, created_by_ref*
|[stixtr]*Optional Common Properties*
|*revoked*, *labels*, *external_references*, *object_marking_refs*, *granular_markings*
|[stixtr]*Not Applicable Common Properties*
|*confidence*, *lang*, *defanged*, *extensions*
|[stixtr]*Extension Definition Specific Properties*
|*name*, *description*, *schema*, *version*, *extension_types*, *extension_properties*
|===

[width="100%",cols="27%,16%,57%",]
|===
|*Property Name* |*Data Type* |*Details*

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *type* property identifies the type of object. The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#extension-definition#.

|*name* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|A name used for display purposes during execution, development, or debugging.

|*description* (optional)
|[stixtype]#string#
|A detailed explanation of what data the extension conveys and how it is intended to be used.

While the description property is optional this property *SHOULD* be populated.

Note that the *schema* property is the normative definition of the extension, and this property, if present, is for documentation purposes only.

|*schema* (required) 
|[stixtype]#string#
|The normative definition of the extension, either as a URL or as plain text explaining the definition.

A URL *SHOULD* point to a JSON schema or a location that contains information about the schema.

*NOTE:* It is recommended that an external reference be provided to the comprehensive documentation of the extension-definition.

|*version* (required) 
|[stixtype]#string#
|The version of this extension. Producers of STIX extensions are encouraged to follow standard semantic versioning procedures where the version number follows the pattern, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This will allow consumers to distinguish between the three different levels of compatibility typically identified by such versioning strings.

As with all STIX Objects, changing a STIX extension definition could involve STIX versioning. See <<_new_version_or_new_object>> for more information on versioning an object versus creating a new one.

|*extension_types* (required) 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#enum#
|This property specifies one or more extension types contained within this extension.

The values for this property *MUST* come from the [stixvocab]#<<_extension_type_enumeration,extension-type-enum>># enumeration.

When this property includes [stixliteral]#toplevel-property-extension# then the *extension_properties* property *SHOULD* include one or more property names.

|*extension_properties* (optional) 
|[stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#string#
|This property contains the list of new property names that are added to an object by an extension.

This property *MUST* only be used when the *extension_types* property includes a value of [stixliteral]#toplevel-property-extension#.
In other words, when new properties are being added at the top-level of an existing object.

|===

==== Requirements for STIX Extension Schemas

===== Requirements for Extension STIX Objects

* Producers *MAY* include any number of STIX Extensions in STIX content.
* Extension STIX Objects *MUST* support the Common Properties as defined in <<_common_properties>>.
** Common property names *MUST NOT* be reused to represent the custom properties in the object.

* Extension STIX Object names *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters.
* Extension STIX Object names *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
* The value of the *id* property in a Extension STIX Object *MUST* use the same format as the [stixtype]#identifier# type, namely, [stixalt]#[object-type]--[UUID]#.
* Extension STIX Objects *SHOULD* only be used when there is no existing STIX Object defined by the STIX specification that fulfils that need.

*Examples (additional examples can be found in <<_additional_examples>>)*

== STIX Bundle Object

*Type Name:* [stixtype]#bundle#

A Bundle is a collection of arbitrary STIX Objects grouped together in a single container.
A Bundle does not have any semantic meaning and the objects contained within the Bundle are not considered related by virtue of being in the same Bundle.

A STIX Bundle Object is not a STIX Object but makes use of the *type* and *id* Common Properties.
A Bundle is transient, and implementations *SHOULD NOT* assume that other implementations will treat it as a persistent object or keep any custom properties found on the bundle itself.

The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type <<RFC8259>> when representing [stixtype]#bundle#.

=== Properties

[width="100%",cols="32%,27%,41%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Property Name* |[stixtr]*Type* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*type* (required)
|[stixtype]#string#
|The *type* property identifies the type of object. The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#bundle#.

|*id* (required) 
|[stixtype]#identifier#
|An identifier for this Bundle. The *id* property for the Bundle is designed to help tools that may need it for processing, however, tools are not required to store or track it. Tools that consume STIX should not rely on the ability to refer to bundles by ID.

=== Definitions

The terms defined below are used throughout this document.

[width="100%",cols="30%,43%,27%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Terms* |[stixtr]*Definitions* |[stixtr]*Example*

|whitespace 
|Any Unicode code point that has WSpace set as a property, for example, line feeds, carriage returns, tabs, and spaces.
|n/a

|Observation
|Observations represent data about systems or networks that is observed at a particular point in time - for example, information about a file that existed, a process that was observed running, or network traffic that was transmitted between two IPs.
In STIX, Observations are represented by Observed Data SDOs, with *number_observed* observations occurring between their *first_observed* and *last_observed* timestamps.
It is not defined when the observations occur within that time window.

For additional background, refer to the STIX Observed Data object definition in <<_observed_data>>. 
|n/a

|Comparison Expression
|Comparison Expressions are the basic components of Observation Expressions.
They consist of an Object Path and a constant joined by a Comparison Operator (listed in <<_comparison_operators>>, Comparison Operators).
a|
--------------------------------------
user-account:value = 'Peter'
--------------------------------------

|Comparison Operators
|Comparison Operators are used within Comparison Expressions to compare an Object Path against a constant or set of constants.
a|
--------------------------------------
MATCHES
--------------------------------------

|Object Path 
|Object Paths define which properties of STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCO) should be evaluated as part of a Comparison Expression.
SCOs and their properties are defined in <<_stix_cyber_observable_objects_2>>. 
a|
--------------------------------------
ipv6-addr:value
--------------------------------------

|Observation Expression 
|Observation Expressions consist of one or more Comparison Expressions joined with Boolean Operators and surrounded by square brackets.

An Observation Expression may consist of two Observation Expressions joined by an Observation Operator.
This may be applied recursively to compose multiple Observation Expressions into a single Observation Expression.

Observation Expressions may optionally be followed by one or more Qualifiers further constraining the result set.
Qualifiers may be applied to all of the Observation Expressions joined with Observation Operators; in this case, parentheses should be used to group the set of Observation Expressions, with the Qualifier following the closing parenthesis.

a|
--------------------------------------
[ipv4-addr:value = '203.0.113.1' OR ipv4-addr:value = '203.0.113.2']
--------------------------------------
or (with Observation Operator):
--------------------------------------
([ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.5'] FOLLOWEDBY [ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.10'])
--------------------------------------
or (with Observation Operator and Qualifier):
--------------------------------------
([ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.5' ] AND [ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.10']) WITHIN 300 SECONDS
--------------------------------------

|Boolean Operators
|Boolean Operators are used to combine Comparison Expressions within an Observation Expression. 
a|
(Comparison Expressions)
--------------------------------------
user-account:value = 'Peter' OR user-account:value = 'Mary'
--------------------------------------

|Qualifier
|Qualifiers provide a restriction on the Observations that are considered valid for matching the preceding Observation Expression. 
a|
--------------------------------------
[file:name = 'foo.dll'] START t'2016-06-01T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2016-07-01T00:00:00Z'
--------------------------------------

|Observation Operators
|Observation Operators are used to combine two Observation Expressions operating on two different Observed Data instances into a single pattern.

Note that some Observation Operators have the same name as Boolean Operators.
However, the former connects Comparison Expressions and the latter connects Observation Expressions, and therefore each has slightly different semantics.

a|
--------------------------------------
[ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.5'] AND [ ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.10']
--------------------------------------

|Pattern Expression
|A Pattern Expression represents a valid instance of a STIX cyber observable pattern.
The most basic Pattern Expression consists of a single Observation Expression containing a single Comparison Expression.

=== Constants

The data types enumerated below are supported as operands within Comparison Expressions.
This table is included here as a handy reference for implementers.

Note that unlike SCOs (which are defined in terms of the MTI JSON serialization), STIX Patterns are Unicode strings, regardless of the underlying serialization, hence the data types defined in the table below in some cases differ from the definitions contained in <<_common_data_types>>.

Each constant defined in Patterning has a limited set of STIX Data types that they are allowed to be compared against.
In some cases, there are multiple STIX Data Types that could be compared against a STIX Patterning Constant; this is due to the fact that certain STIX Data Types are semantically indistinguishable because of their JSON serialization.
The STIX Comparable Data Type(s) column in the table below defines these limitations.

[width="100%",cols="28%,23%,49%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*STIX Patterning Constant* |[stixtr]*STIX Comparable Data Type(s)* |[stixtr]*Description*

|*boolean*
|[stixtype]#boolean#
|A constant of [stixtype]#boolean# type encodes truth or falsehood. Boolean truth is denoted by the literal [stixliteral]#true# and falsehood by the literal [stixliteral]#false#.

|*binary*
|[stixtype]#binary# +
[stixtype]#hex# +
[stixtype]#string#
a|A constant of [stixtype]#binary# type is a base64 encoded array of octets (8-bit bytes) per <<RFC4648>>.
The base64 string *MUST* be surrounded by apostrophes (''' U+0027) and prefixed by a 'b' (U+0062).
Line feeds in the base64 encoded data *MUST* be supported and ignored but are not required to be inserted.

Example:
--------------------------------------
b'ABI='
--------------------------------------

|[stixtype]*hex*
|[stixtype]#binary# +
[stixtype]#hex# +
[stixtype]#string#
a|A constant of [stixtype]#hex# type encodes an array of octets (8-bit bytes) as hexadecimal.
The string *MUST* consist of an even number of hexadecimal characters, which are the digits '0' through '9' and the letters 'a' through 'f'.
The hex string *MUST* be surrounded by apostrophes (''' U+0027) and prefixed by an 'h' (U+0068).

Example:
--------------------------------------
h'ffc3'
--------------------------------------

|*integer* 
|[stixtype]#integer# +
[stixtype]#float# 
|A constant of [stixtype]#integer# type encodes a signed decimal number in the usual fashion (e.g., 123).
In the case of positive integers, the integer *MUST* be represented as-is, omitting the plus sign ('+' U+002b).
Negative integers *MUST* be represented by prepending a hyphen-minus ('-' U+002d).

When compared against a [stixtype]#float#, the full value must be compared and must not be truncated.
For example, the result of comparing a STIX Patterning constant integer value of 1 to a [stixtype]#float# value of 1.5 is not equal.

The valid range of values is defined in <<_common_data_types>>.

|*float*
|[stixtype]#integer# +
[stixtype]#float#
|A constant of [stixtype]#float# type encodes a floating-point number in the usual fashion (e.g., 123.456).
In the case of positive floating-point number, the floating-point number *MUST* be represented as-is, omitting the plus sign' ('+' U+002b). Negative floating point-numbers *MUST* be represented by prepending a hyphen-minus ('-' U+002d).

The valid range of values is defined in section <<_common_data_types>>.

|*string*
|[stixtype]#string# +
[stixtype]#binary# +
[stixtype]#hex#
|A constant of [stixtype]#string# type encodes a string as a list of Unicode code points surrounded by apostrophes (''' U+0027).

The escape character is the backslash ('\' U+005c). Only the apostrophe or the backslash may follow, and in that case, the respective character is used for the sequence.

If a string only contains codepoints less than (U+0100), then the string *MAY* be converted to a binary type value (if needed for comparison). The mapping is code point U+0000 to 00 through U+00ff to ff.

|*timestamp* 
|[stixtype]#timestamp#
a|A constant of [stixtype]#timestamp# type encodes a STIX timestamp (as specified in <<_timestamp>>) as a string.
The timestamp string *MUST* be surrounded by apostrophes (''' U+0027) and prefixed with a 't' (U+0074).

Example:
--------------------------------------
t'2014-01-13T07:03:17Z'
--------------------------------------
|===

=== STIX Patterns

STIX Patterns are composed of multiple building blocks, ranging from simple key-value comparisons to more complex, context-sensitive expressions.
The most fundamental building block is the Comparison Expression, which is a comparison between a single property of a SCO and a given constant using a Comparison Operator.
As a simple example, one might use the following Comparison Expression (contained within an Observation Expression) to match against an IPv4 address:
--------------------------------------
[ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.1/32']
--------------------------------------
Moving up a level of complexity, the next building block of a STIX Pattern is the Observation Expression, which consists of one or more Comparison Expressions joined by Boolean Operators and bounded by square brackets.
An Observation Expression refines which set of cyber observable data (i.e., as part of an Observation) will match the pattern, by selecting the set that has the SCOs specified by the Comparison Expressions.
An Observation Expression consisting of a single Comparison Expression is the most basic valid STIX Pattern.
Building upon the previous example, one might construct an Observation Expression to match against multiple IPv4 addresses and an IPv6 address:
--------------------------------------
[ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.1/32' OR ipv4-addr:value = '203.0.113.33/32' OR ipv6-addr:value = '2001:0db8:dead:beef:dead:beef:dead:0001/128']
--------------------------------------
Observation Expressions may be followed by one or more Qualifiers, which allow for the expression of further restrictions on the set of data matching the pattern.
Continuing with the above example, one might use a Qualifier to state that the IP addresses must be observed several times in repetition:
--------------------------------------
[ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.1/32' OR ipv4-addr:value = '203.0.113.33/32' OR ipv6-addr:value = '2001:0db8:dead:beef:dead:beef:dead:0001/128'] REPEATS 5 TIMES
--------------------------------------
The final, highest level building block of STIX Patterning combines two or more Object Expressions via Observation Operators, yielding a STIX Pattern capable of matching across multiple STIX Observed Data SDOs.
Building further upon our previous example, one might use an Observation Operator to specify that an observation of a particular domain name must follow the observation of the IP addresses (note the use of parentheses to encapsulate the two Observation Expressions), along with a different Qualifier to state that both the IP address and domain name must be observed within a specific time window:
--------------------------------------
([ipv4-addr:value = '198.51.100.1/32' OR ipv4-addr:value = '203.0.113.33/32' OR ipv6-addr:value = '2001:0db8:dead:beef:dead:beef:dead:0001/128'] FOLLOWEDBY [domain-name:value = 'example.com']) WITHIN 600 SECONDS
--------------------------------------
The diagram below depicts a truncated version of the various STIX Patterning components in the above example.

image:images/stix_patterning_components.png[images/STIX Patterning Components,width=624,height=164]

=== Pattern Expressions

Pattern Expressions evaluate to true or false.
They comprise one or more Observation Expressions joined by Observation Operators.
Pattern Expressions are evaluated against a set of specific Observations.
If one or more of those Observations match the Pattern Expression, then it evaluates to true.
If no Observations match, the Pattern Expression evaluates to false.

Pattern Expressions *MUST* be encoded as Unicode strings.

Whitespace (i.e., Unicode code points where WSpace=Y)# in the pattern string is used to delimit parts of the pattern, including keywords, constants, and field objects.
Whitespace characters between operators, including line feeds and carriage returns, *MUST* be allowed.
Multiple whitespace characters in a row *MUST* be treated as a single whitespace character.

An invalid pattern resulting from parsing error or invalid constants (e.g., an invalid hex or binary constant) *MUST* *NOT* match any Observations.

=== Observation Expressions

Observation Expressions comprise one or more Comparison Expressions, joined via Boolean Operators.

Observation Expressions *MUST* be delimited by left square bracket ('[' U+005b) and right square bracket (']' U+005d).
One or more Observation Expression Qualifiers *MAY* be provided after the closing square bracket or closing parenthesis of an Observation Expression.
Observation Expressions *MAY* be joined by Observation Operators.

Individual Observation Expressions (e.g., [stixalt]#[a = b]#) match against a single Observation, i.e., a single STIX Observed Data instance.
In cases where matching against _multiple_ Observations is required, two or more Observation Expressions may be combined via Observation Operators, indicating that the pattern *MUST* be evaluated against two or more distinct Observations; however, in the case of [stixliteral]#OR#, if the first Observation Expression evaluates to true, then evaluation *MUST* terminate and return [stixliteral]#true#.

When matching an Observation against an Observation Expression, all Comparison Expressions contained within the Observation Expression *MUST* start matching against the same SCO in the Observation.
That is, when resolving object paths of each Comparison Expression, the <object-type>:<property_name> *MUST* start from the same SCO.
Different SCO's may ultimately be used in matching, but they *MUST* be referenced from the same, single SCO.

For example, the following observed data does not match this example observation clause because although these IP addresses are both part of the same observed-data object, there is not a single network-traffic SCO that references each IP address, and therefore does not satisfy the condition in the preceding paragraph:

--------------------------------------
[ network-traffic:src_ref.value = '203.0.113.10' AND network-traffic:dst_ref.value = '198.51.100.58' ]
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "observed-data",
  "id": "observed-data--0960319a-3cab-4258-a143-4dbb25525bb1",
  "first_observed": "2019-10-20T00:12:01.000000Z",
  "last_observed": "2019-10-20T00:51:02.000000Z",
  "number_observed": 1,
  "objects": {
    "0": {
      "type": "network-traffic",
      "src_ref": "1"
    },
    "1": {
      "type": "ipv4-addr",
      "value": "203.0.113.10"
    },
    "2": {
      "type": "network-traffic",
      "dst_ref": "3"
    },
    "3": {
      "type": "ipv4-addr",
      "value": "198.51.100.58"
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------

An Observation Expression *MAY* contain Comparison Expressions with Object Paths that start with different object types, but such Comparison Expressions *MUST* be joined by OR.
All operands of AND in an Observation Expression *MUST* be satisfiable with the same object.

For example, consider the following Pattern Expression:

--------------------------------------
[(type-a:property-j = 'W' AND type-a:property-k = 'X') OR (type-b:property-m = 'Y' AND type-b:property-n = 'Z')]
--------------------------------------

This expression can match an Observable with an object of either type-a or type-b, but both Comparison Expressions for that specific type must evaluate to true for the same object.
Comparison Expressions that are intended to match a single object type can be joined by either AND or OR.
For example:
--------------------------------------
[type-a:property-j = 'W' AND type-a:property-k = 'X' OR type-a:property-l = 'Z']
--------------------------------------
As AND has higher precedence than OR, the preceding example requires an Observation to have either both property-j = 'W' AND property-k = 'X' or just property-l = 'Z'.

Observation Expressions, along with their Observation Operators and optional Qualifiers, *MAY* be surrounded with parentheses to delineate which Observation Expressions the Qualifiers apply to. For example:
--------------------------------------
([ a ] AND [ b ] REPEATS 5 TIMES) WITHIN 5 MINUTES
--------------------------------------
The preceding example results in one _a_ and 5 _b_'s that all match in a 5-minute period. As another example:
--------------------------------------
([ a ] AND [ b ]) REPEATS 5 TIMES WITHIN 5 MINUTES
--------------------------------------
The preceding example results in 5 _a_'s and 5 _b_'s (10 Observations) that all match in a 5-minute period.

==== Observation Expression Qualifiers

Each Observation Expression *MAY* have additional temporal or repetition restrictions using the respective [stixliteral]#WITHIN#, [stixliteral]#START#/[stixliteral]#STOP#, and [stixliteral]#REPEATS# keywords.
An Observation Expression *MUST NOT* have more than one Qualifier of a particular type.

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Qualifiers* |[stixtr]*Description*

|_a_ [stixliteral]#REPEATS# _x_ [stixliteral]#TIMES#
a|_a_ *MUST* be an Observation Expression or a preceding Qualifier.
_a_ *MUST* match at least _x_ times, where each match is a different Observation.
_x_ *MUST* be a positive integer.

This is purely a shorthand way of writing:

"_a"_ followed by "AND _a",_ x-1 times.

Example:
--------------------------------------
[ b ] FOLLOWEDBY [ c ] REPEATS 5 TIMES
--------------------------------------
In this example, the [stixliteral]#REPEATS# applies to _c_, and it does not apply to _b_.
The results will be _b_ plus 5 _c_'s where all 5 _c_'s were observed after the _b_.
Note that there is only a single Qualifier in this example; more complex patterns may use more than one.

|_a_ [stixliteral]#WITHIN# _x_ [stixliteral]#SECONDS#
a|_a_ *MUST* be an Observation Expression or a preceding Qualifier.
All Observations matched by _a_ *MUST* occur, or have been observed, within the specified time window.
_x_ *MUST* be a positive floating-point or integer value.

If there is a set of two or more Observations matched by _a_, the most recent Observation timestamp contained within that set *MUST NOT* be equal to or later than the delta of the earliest Observation timestamp within the set plus the specified time window.

Example:
--------------------------------------
([file:hashes.'SHA-256' = '13987239847...'] AND [windows-registry-key:key = 'hkey']) WITHIN 120 SECONDS
--------------------------------------
The above Pattern Expression looks for a file hash and a registry key that were observed within 120 seconds of each other.
The parentheses are needed to apply the [stixliteral]#WITHIN# Qualifier to both Observation Expressions.

|_a_ [stixliteral]#START# _x_ [stixliteral]#STOP# _y_ 
a|_a_ *MUST* be an Observation Expression or a preceding Qualifier.
All Observations that match _a_ *MUST* have an observation time >= _x_ and < _y_.

_x_ and _y_ *MUST* be of type [stixtype]#timestamp#.

In the event that the Pattern Expression is being used inside a STIX Indicator *pattern* property (see <<_indicator>>) _x_ *SHOULD* be greater than or equal to the value contained in the *valid_from* Indicator property, and _y_ *SHOULD* be less than or equal to the value contained in the *valid_until* Indicator property.

|===

==== Observation Operators

Two or more Observation Expressions *MAY* be combined using an Observation Operator in order to further constrain the set of Observations that match against the Pattern Expression.

[width="100%",cols="30%,43%,27%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Observation Operators* |[stixtr]*Description* |[stixtr]*Associativity*

|[ _a_ ] [stixliteral]#AND# [ _b_ ] 
|_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both be Observation Expressions and *MUST* both evaluate to true on _different_ Observations. 
|Left to right

|[ _a_ ] [stixliteral]#OR# [ _b_ ] 
|_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both be Observation Expressions and one of _a_ or _b_ *MUST* evaluate to true on _different_ Observations. 
|Left to right

|[ _a_ ] [stixliteral]#FOLLOWEDBY# [ _b_ ] 
|_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both be Observation Expressions. Both _a_ and _b_ *MUST* both evaluate to true, where the observation timestamp associated with _b_ is greater than or equal to the observation timestamp associated with _a_ and *MUST* evaluate to true on _different_ Observations. 
|Left to right

|===

For example, consider the following Pattern Expression:
--------------------------------------
[ a = 'b' ] FOLLOWEDBY [ c = 'd' ] REPEATS 5 TIMES
--------------------------------------
The preceding expression says to match an Observation with _a_ equal to 'b' that precedes 5 occurrences of Observations that have _c_ equal to 'd', for a total of 6 Observations matched. This interpretation is due to qualifiers not being greedy and is equivalent to [ a = 'b' ] FOLLOWEDBY ( [ c = 'd' ] REPEATS 5 TIMES).

Alternatively, using parentheses to group the initial portion, we get the following example:
--------------------------------------
([ a = 'b' ] FOLLOWEDBY [ c = 'd' ]) REPEATS 5 TIMES
--------------------------------------
The preceding expression will match 5 pairs of Observations where _a_ equals 'b' followed by an Observation where _c_ is equal to 'd', for a total of 10 Observations matched.

==== Operator Precedence

Operator associativity and precedence may be overridden by the use of parentheses.
Unless otherwise specified, operator associativity (including for parentheses) is left-to-right.
Precedence in the below table is from highest to lowest.

=== Comparison Expressions

Comparison Expressions are the most basic components of STIX Patterning, comprising an Object Path and a constant joined by a Comparison Operator.
Each Comparison Expression is a singleton, and so they are evaluated from left to right.

A Boolean Operator joins two Comparison Expressions together.
In the following table, _a_ or _b_ is either a Comparison Expression or a composite expression (which may be composed recursively) consisting of two or more Comparison Expressions joined with Boolean Operators and enclosed by parentheses.

[width="100%",cols="22%,60%,18%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Boolean Operator* |[stixtr]*Description* |[stixtr]*Associativity*

|_a_ [stixliteral]#AND# _b_ 
a|_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both be Comparison Expressions or a composite expression (which may be composed recursively) consisting of two or more Comparison Expressions joined with Boolean Operators and enclosed by parentheses.

_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both evaluate to true on the same Observation.
|Left to right

|_a_ [stixliteral]#OR# _b_ 
a|
_a_ and _b_ *MUST* both be Comparison Expressions or a composite expression (which may be composed recursively) consisting of two or more Comparison Expressions joined with Boolean Operators and enclosed by parentheses.

Either _a_ or _b_ *MUST* evaluate to true.
|Left to right

|===

Comparison Expressions may include one or more Object Path(s) not obtainable within a given Observation, either because the Object Path(s) are not present within the Observation or because the evaluating entity does not have access to the data necessary in order to evaluate the specified Object Path(s).
When evaluating a Comparison Expression against one or more Object Path(s) that are not present or whose data cannot be obtained, the Comparison Expression *MUST* evaluate to *FALSE*, regardless of the operators included in the expression.

==== Comparison Operators

The table below describes the available Comparison Operators for use in Comparison Expressions; in the table, _a_ *MUST* be an Object Path and _b_ *MUST* be a constant.
If the arguments to the Comparison Operators are of incompatible types (e.g., the Object Path is an integer and the constant is a string), the results are false; the sole exception is the [stixliteral]#!=# operator in which case the result is true.
Some STIX Patterning constants and STIX data types may be comparable in a Comparison Expression.
For example, the [stixtype]#hex# and [stixtype]#binary# types both represent binary data, and their representative binary data is that which must be compared for equality.
See  <<_common_data_types>> for type compatibility between STIX Patterning and STIX types.

A Comparison Operator *MAY* be preceded by the modifier [stixliteral]#NOT#, in which case the resultant Comparison Expression is logically negated.

==== String Comparison

For simple string operators, i.e., "[stixliteral]#=#", "[stixliteral]#!=#", "[stixliteral]#<#", "[stixliteral]#>#", "[stixliteral]#<=#" and "[stixliteral]#>=#", as collation languages and methods are unspecifiable, a simple code point (binary) comparison *MUST* be used.
If one string is longer than the other, but otherwise equal, the longer string is greater than, but not equal to, the shorter string.
Unicode normalization *MUST NOT* be performed on the string.
This means that combining marks <<Davis>> are sorted by their code point, not the NFC normalized value.
E.g. 'o' U+006f < 'oz' U+006f U+007a < 'ò' U+006f U+0300 < 'z' U+007a < ‘ò' U+00f2.
Although Unicode recommends normalizing strings for comparisons, the use of combining marks may be significant, and normalizing by default would remove this information.

NFC normalization is, however, required for other Comparison Operators, e.g., [stixliteral]#LIKE# and [stixliteral]#MATCHES#.

==== Binary Type Comparison

When the value of two binary object properties are compared, they are compared as unsigned octets.
That is, [stixliteral]#00# is less than [stixliteral]#ff#. If one value is longer than the other, but they are otherwise equal, the longer value is considered greater than, but not equal to, the shorter value.

==== Native Format Comparison

The SCO's value *MUST* be in its native format when doing the comparison.
For example, Cyber-observable Object properties that use the [stixtype]#binary# type (defined in <<_binary>>) must have their value decoded into its constituent bytes prior to comparison.
This also means that Object Properties which use the [stixtype]#hex# type must be decoded into raw octets prior to being evaluated.

In cases where a binary SCO property (i.e., one ending with *_bin* or *_hex*) is evaluated against a string constant, the string constant *MUST* be converted into a binary constant when all of the constituent string code points are less than U+0100.
If this conversion is not possible, the comparison *MUST* evaluate to false, unless the comparison operator is [stixliteral]#!=#, in which case it *MUST* evaluate to true.

For example, given the following object, where the *payload_bin* property is of [stixtype]#binary# type:
--------------------------------------
{
  "0":{
    "type": "artifact",
    "mime_type": "application/octet-stream",
    "payload_bin": "dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q="
  }
}
--------------------------------------

The pattern
--------------------------------------
"artifact:payload_bin = 'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q='" 
--------------------------------------
would evaluate to false, while the following patterns would all evaluate to true:
--------------------------------------
"artifact:payload_bin = 'this is a test'", "artifact:payload_bin = b'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q='",
--------------------------------------
and 
--------------------------------------
"artifact:payload_bin = h'7468697320697320612074657374'".
--------------------------------------

=== Object Path Syntax

Defined below is the syntax for addressing properties of SCOs within a STIX Pattern.
The following notation is used throughout the definitions below:

[width="100%",cols="32%,68%",]
|===
|[stixtr]*Notation* |[stixtr]*Definition*

|<object-type>
|The type of SCO to match against.
This *MUST* be the value of the *type* field specified for a given SCO in an Observation.

|<property_name> 
a|The name of a SCO property to match against.
This *MUST* be a valid property name as specified in the definition of the SCO type referenced by the <object-type> notation.

If the <property_name> contains a hyphen-minus ('-' U+002d) or a full stop ('.' U+002e), the <property_name> *MUST* be enclosed in apostrophes (''' U+0027).

Properties that are nested (i.e., are children of other properties in a SCO) *MUST* be specified using the syntax <property_name>.<property_name>, where the <property_name> preceding the ''.' is the name of the parent property and the one following is the name of the child property.

If the property name is a reference to another SCO, the referenced Object *MUST* be dereferenced, so that its properties function as if they are nested in the Object that it is referenced by.
For example, if the *src_ref* property of the Network Traffic object references an IPv4 Address object, the value of this IPv4 address would be specified by *network-traffic:src_ref.value*.

*NOTE:* the STIX Patterning language currently does not support specifying and/or dereferencing top-level relationships between SCOs as part of its object syntax.
Therefore, it is recommended to use the deprecated embedded relationships for this purpose, if necessary.

|===

==== Basic Object Properties

Any non-dictionary and non-list property that is directly specified on a SCO.

*Syntax*

<object-type>:<property_name>

*Example*
--------------------------------------
file:size
--------------------------------------

==== List Object Properties

Any property on a SCO that uses the [stixtype]#list# data type.

*Syntax*

<object-type>:<property_name>[list_index].<property_name>

Where the first property_name *MUST* be the name of an Object property of type [stixtype]#list# and list_index *MUST* be one of the following:

* An integer in the range of 0...N-1, where N is the length of the list. If _list_index_ is out of range, the result of any operation is false.
* The literal '#*' indicates that all of the items in the list shall be tried as a value to be evaluated with the Comparison Operator and other value. If any of these evaluations are true, then the result is true.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
file:extensions.'windows-pebinary-ext'.sections[*].entropy

network-traffic:protocols[0]
--------------------------------------

==== Dictionary Object Properties

Any property on an SCO that uses the [stixtype]#dictionary# data type.

*Syntax*

<object-type>:<property_name>.<key_name>

Where <property_name> *MUST* be the name of an Object property of type [stixtype]#dictionary# and <key_name> *MUST* be the name of key in the dictionary.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
file:hashes.ssdeep

file:extensions.'raster-image-ext'.image_height
--------------------------------------

==== Object Reference Properties

Any property on an SCO that represents an embedded relationship and uses the [stixtype]#identifier# data type, either as a singleton or as a list (i.e., [stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#).

*Syntax*

<object-type>:<property_name>.<dereferenced_object_property>

Where <property_name> *MUST* be the name of an Object property that represents an embedded relationships and is of type identifier and <dereferenced_object_property> *MUST* be the name of a valid property of the dereferenced Object (i.e., the Object in an Observation that is referenced via <property_name>).

For example, when processing the Observed Data SDO that uses the *object_refs* property instead of the deprecated *objects* property, only those SCO's that are listed in the *object_refs* may be followed.
This means that if the object [stixtype]#identifier# is not listed in *object_refs* property, then that object is considered not found, and any references to properties of that object are considered not present.

For cases where <property_name> represents a list of embedded relationships and is a [stixtype]#list# of type [stixtype]#identifier#, the corresponding syntax applies:

<object-type>:<property_name>[list_index].<dereferenced_object_property>

Accordingly, the same semantics for list indices as defined in <<_list_object_properties>> apply in this case.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
email-message:from_ref.value

directory:contains_refs[*].name
--------------------------------------

== STIX Vocabularies

The following sections provide object-specific listings for each of the vocabularies referenced in the object description sections defined in <<_stix_domain_objects_2>>, <<_stix_relationship_objects>>, <<_stix_cyber_observable_objects_2>>, and <<_stix_meta_objects>>.

STIX vocabularies that have type names ending in '-ov', are "open": they provide a listing of common and industry accepted terms as a guide to the user but do not limit the user to that defined list.
These vocabularies are referenced from the STIX Objects as type [stixtype]#open-vocab# and have a statement indicating which vocabulary should be used.

STIX vocabularies that have type names ending in '-enum' are "closed": the only valid values are those in the vocabulary.
These vocabularies are referenced from the STIX Objects as type [stixtype]#enum# and have a statement indicating which enumeration must be used.

=== Account Type Vocabulary

=== Attack Motivation Vocabulary

*Vocabulary Name:* [stixtype]#attack-motivation-ov#

The attack motivation vocabulary is currently used in the following SDOs:

* Intrusion Set
* Threat Actor

Knowing a Threat Actor or Intrusion Set's motivation may allow an analyst or defender to better understand likely targets and behaviors.

Motivation shapes the intensity and the persistence of an attack.
Threat Actors and Intrusion Sets usually act in a manner that reflects their underlying emotion or situation, and this informs defenders of the manner of attack.
For example, a cyber-vandal out for notoriety can create an intense and attention-grabbing attack but may quickly lose interest and move on.
Understanding these differences allows defenders to implement controls tailored to each type of attack for greatest efficiency.

|===
|[stixtr]*Vocabulary Value* |[stixtr]*Description*

|[stixliteral]#accidental#
|A non-hostile actor whose benevolent or harmless intent inadvertently causes harm.

For example, a well-meaning and dedicated employee who through distraction or poor training unintentionally causes harm to his or her organization.

|[stixliteral]#coercion#
|Being forced to act on someone else's behalf.

Adversaries who are motivated by coercion are often forced through intimidation or blackmail to act illegally for someone else’s benefit. Unlike the other motivations, a coerced person does not act for personal gain, but out of fear of incurring a loss.

|[stixliteral]#dominance#
|A desire to assert superiority over someone or something else.

Adversaries who are seeking dominance over a target are focused on using their power to force their target into submission or irrelevance.

|[stixliteral]#ideology#
|A passion to express a set of ideas, beliefs, and values that may shape and drive harmful and illegal acts.

Adversaries who act for ideological reasons are not usually motivated primarily by the desire for profit; they are acting on their own sense of morality, justice, or political loyalty.

For example, an activist group may sabotage a company’s equipment because they believe the company is harming the environment.

|[stixliteral]#notoriety#
|Seeking prestige or to become well known through some activity.

Adversaries motivated by notoriety are often seeking either personal validation or respect within a community and staying covert is not a priority. In fact, one of the main goals is to garner the respect of their target audience.

|[stixliteral]#organizational-gain#
|Seeking advantage over a competing organization.

Adversaries motivated by increased profit or other gains through an unfairly obtained competitive advantage are often seeking theft of intellectual property, business processes, or supply chain agreements and thus accelerating their position in a market or capability.

|[stixliteral]#personal-gain#
|The desire to improve one's own financial status.

Adversaries motivated by a selfish desire for personal gain are often out for gains that come from financial fraud, hacking for hire, or intellectual property theft.

While a Threat Actor or Intrusion Set may be seeking personal gain, this does not mean they are acting alone. Individuals can band together solely to maximize their own personal profits.

|[stixliteral]#personal-satisfaction#
|A desire to satisfy a strictly personal goal, including curiosity, thrill-seeking, amusement, etc.

Threat Actors or Intrusion Set driven by personal satisfaction may incidentally receive some other gain from their actions, such as a profit, but their primary motivation is to gratify a personal, emotional need. Individuals can band together with others toward a mutual, but not necessarily organizational, objective.

|[stixliteral]#revenge#
|A desire to avenge perceived wrongs through harmful actions such as sabotage, violence, theft, fraud, or embarrassing certain individuals or the organization.

A disgruntled Threat Actor or Intrusion Set seeking revenge can include current or former employees, who may have extensive knowledge to leverage when conducting attacks. Individuals can band together with others if the individual believes that doing so will enable them to cause more harm.

|[stixliteral]#unpredictable#
|Acting without identifiable reason or purpose and creating unpredictable events.

Unpredictable is not a miscellaneous or default category. Unpredictable means a truly random and likely bizarre event, which seems to have no logical purpose to the victims.

=== Attack Resource Level Vocabulary

*Vocabulary Name:* [stixtype]#attack-resource-level-ov#

The attack resource level vocabulary is currently used in the following SDO(s):

* Intrusion Set
* Threat Actor

Attack Resource Level is an open vocabulary that captures the general level of resources that a threat actor, intrusion set, or campaign might have access to. It ranges from individual, a person acting alone, to government, the resources of a national government.

|[stixliteral]#individual#
|Resources limited to the average individual; Threat Actor acts independently.

|[stixliteral]#club#
|Members interact on a social and volunteer basis, often with little personal interest in the specific target. An example might be a core group of unrelated activists who regularly exchange tips on a particular blog. Group persists long term.

|[stixliteral]#contest#
|A short-lived and perhaps anonymous interaction that concludes when the participants have achieved a single goal. For example, people who break into systems just for thrills or prestige may hold a contest to see who can break into a specific target first.

|[stixliteral]#team#
|A formally organized group with a leader, typically motivated by a specific goal and organized around that goal. Group persists long term and typically operates within a single geography.

|[stixliteral]#organization#
|Larger and better resourced than a team; typically, a company or crime syndicate. Usually operates in multiple geographic areas and persists long term.

|[stixliteral]#government#
|Controls public assets and functions within a jurisdiction; very well resourced and persists long term.

|[stixliteral]#activist#
|Highly motivated, potentially destructive supporter of a social or political cause (e.g., trade, labor, environment, etc.) that attempts to disrupt an organization's business model or damage their image.

This category includes actors sometimes referred to as anarchists, cyber vandals, extremists, and hacktivists.

|[stixliteral]#competitor#
|An organization that competes in the same economic marketplace.

The goal of a competitor is to gain an advantage in business with respect to the rival organization it targets.
It usually does this by copying intellectual property, trade secrets, acquisition strategies, or other technical or business data from a rival organization with the intention of using the data to bolster its own assets and market position.

|[stixliteral]#crime-syndicate#
|An enterprise organized to conduct significant, large-scale criminal activity for profit.

Crime syndicates, also known as organized crime, are generally large, well-resourced groups that operate to create profit from all types of crime.

|[stixliteral]#criminal#
|Individual who commits computer crimes, often for personal financial gain and often involves the theft of something valuable.

Extortion via ransomware and physical destruction are common examples.
A criminal as described here refers to those acting individually or in very small or informal groups.

|[stixliteral]#hacker#
|An individual that tends to break into networks for the thrill or the challenge of doing so.

Hackers may use advanced skills or simple attack scripts they have downloaded.

|[stixliteral]#insider-accidental#
|A non-hostile insider who unintentionally exposes the organization to harm.

"Insider" in this context includes any person extended internal trust, such as regular employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary workers.

|[stixliteral]#insider-disgruntled#
|Current or former insiders who seek revengeful and harmful retaliation for perceived wrongs.

"Insider" in this context includes any person extended internal trust, such as regular employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary workers.

Disgruntled threat actors may have extensive knowledge that can be leveraged when conducting attacks and can take any number of actions including sabotage, violence, theft, fraud, espionage, or embarrassing individuals or the organization.

|[stixliteral]#nation-state#
|Entities who work for the government of a nation state or who work at their direction.

These actors typically have access to significant support, resources, training, and tools and are capable of designing and executing very sophisticated and effective Intrusion Sets and Campaigns.

|[stixliteral]#private-sector#
|Entities who develop and sell attack tools and services for commercial gain.

These actors often do not choose the targets themselves but work for other threat actors who direct the attacks.
These entities are alternatively known as private-sector offensive actors (PSOA), Mercenary APTs, hackers-for-hire, and Cyber Mercenaries.

|[stixliteral]#sensationalist#
|Seeks to cause embarrassment and brand damage by exposing sensitive information in a manner designed to cause a public relations crisis.

A sensationalist may be an individual or small group of people motivated primarily by a need for notoriety.
Unlike the activist, the sensationalist generally has no political goal, and is not using bad PR to influence the target to change its behavior or business practices.

|[stixliteral]#spy#
|Secretly collects sensitive information for use, dissemination, or sale.

Traditional spies (governmental and industrial) are part of a well-resourced intelligence organization and are capable of very sophisticated clandestine operations.
However, insiders such as employees or consultants acting as spies can be just as effective and damaging, even when their activities are largely opportunistic and not part of an overall campaign.

|[stixliteral]#terrorist#
|Uses extreme violence to advance a social or political agenda as well as monetary crimes to support its activities.

In this context a terrorist refers to individuals who target noncombatants with violence to send a message of fear far beyond the actual events.
They may act independently or as part of a terrorist organization.

Terrorist organizations must typically raise much of their operating budget through criminal activity, which often occurs online.
Terrorists are also often adept at using and covertly manipulating social media for both recruitment and impact.

|[stixliteral]#unknown#
|There is not enough information available to determine the type of threat actor.

== Customizing STIX (Deprecated)

_The recommended method to extend STIX is defined by the STIX Extension mechanisms described in <<_extension_definition>>.
These new mechanisms replace the customization mechanisms defined in this section including three means to customize STIX: Custom Properties, Custom Objects and Custom Extensions._
*_These mechanisms are retained for backward-compatibility and should not be used to implement any new extensions of the specification._*

Custom Properties provide a mechanism and requirements for adding properties not defined by this specification to existing STIX Objects.
Custom Objects, on the other hand, provides a mechanism and requirements to create custom STIX Objects (objects not defined by this specification).
Custom Extensions provide a mechanism and requirements for the specification of extensions not defined by this specification on SCOs.

A consumer that receives STIX content containing Custom Properties, Objects, or Extensions it does not understand *MAY* refuse to process the content or *MAY* ignore those properties or objects and continue processing the content.

Producers of STIX content that contain Custom Properties, Objects or Extensions should recognize that consumers may not understand them and may ignore them.
Producers should define any Custom Properties, Objects and Extensions they use, along with any rules for processing them, and make these definitions and rules accessible to any potential consumers.
This specification does not specify a process for doing this.

Custom Properties *SHOULD* be used for cases where it is necessary to add one or more simple additional properties (i.e. key/value pairs) on an SCO.
On the other hand, Custom Extensions *SHOULD* be used for cases where it is necessary to describe more complex additional properties (i.e., those with potentially multiple levels of hierarchy).
As an example, a vendor-specific property that expresses some custom threat score for a File object should be added directly to the SCO as a custom property, whereas a set of properties that represent metadata around a new file system to the File object should be done as a custom extension.

=== Custom Properties (Deprecated)

_Custom properties *SHOULD* be defined using the STIX Extension mechanism for *property-extension* as described in <<_extension_definition>>._

There will be cases where certain information exchanges can be improved by adding properties to STIX Objects and STIX Cyber Observable (SCO) Extensions that are neither specified nor reserved in this specification; these properties are called *Custom Properties*.
This section provides guidance and requirements for how producers can use Custom Properties and how consumers should interpret them in order to extend STIX in an interoperable manner.

==== Requirements (Deprecated)

* A STIX Object *MAY* have any number of STIX Extensions containing one or more properties.
* Custom Property names *MUST* be in ASCII and *MUST* only contain the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and underscore (_).
* Custom Property names *SHOULD* start with "x_" followed by a source unique identifier (such as a domain name with dots replaced by underscores), an underscore and then the name. For example, *x_example_com_customfield*.
* Custom Property names *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters.
* Custom Property names *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
* Custom Property names that do not start with "x_" may be used in a future version of the specification for a different meaning. If compatibility with future versions of this specification is required, the "x_" prefix *MUST* be used.
* Custom Properties *SHOULD* only be used when there are no existing properties defined by the STIX specification that fulfils that need.
* For Custom Properties that use the [stixtype]#hex# type, the property name *MUST* end with '_hex'.
* For Custom Properties that use the [stixtype]#binary# type, the property name *MUST* end with '_bin'.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "x_acme_org_risk_score": 10,
  "x_acme_org_scoring": {
    "impact": "high",
    "probability": "low"
  },
  ...
}
--------------------------------------

=== Custom Objects (Deprecated)

_Custom objects *SHOULD* be defined using the STIX Extension mechanism for *new SDO, new SCO or new SRO* as described in <<_extension_definition>>._

There will be cases where certain information exchanges can be improved by adding objects that are not specified nor reserved in this specification; these objects are called *Custom Objects*.
This section provides guidance and requirements for how producers can use Custom Objects and how consumers should interpret them in order to extend STIX in an interoperable manner.

==== Requirements (Deprecated)

* Producers *MAY* include any number of Custom Objects in STIX content.
* Custom Objects *MUST* support the Common Properties as defined in <<_common_properties>>.
** Common property names *MUST NOT* be reused to represent the custom properties in the object.
* A Custom Object *MUST* have one or more properties.
* The name of a property of a Custom Object *MUST* be in ASCII and *MUST* only contain the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and underscore (_). The "x_" prefix as described in <<_requirements_deprecated>> *MAY* be used.
* The name of a property of a Custom Object *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters.
* The name of a property of a Custom Object *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
* The *type* property in a Custom Object *MUST* be in ASCII and *MUST* only contain the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and hyphen (-).
* The *type* property *MUST NOT* contain a hyphen (-) character immediately following another hyphen (-) character.
* Custom Object names *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters.
* Custom Object names *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
* The value of the *type* property in a Custom Object *SHOULD* start with "x-" followed by a source unique identifier (like a domain name with dots replaced by hyphens), a hyphen and then the name. For example, [stixtype]#x-example-com-customobject#.
* A Custom Object whose name is not prefixed with "x-" may be used in a future version of the specification with a different meaning. Therefore, if compatibility with future versions of this specification is required, the "x-" prefix *MUST* be used.
* The value of the *id* property in a Custom Object *MUST* use the same format as the [stixtype]#identifier# type, namely, [stixalt]#[object-type]--[UUID]#.
* Custom Objects *SHOULD* only be used when there is no existing STIX Object defined by the STIX specification that fulfils that need.

*Examples*
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "bundle",
  "id": "bundle--f37aa79d-f5f5-4af7-874b-734d32c08c10",
  "objects": [
    {
      "type": "x-example-com-customobject",
      "id": "x-example-com-customobject--4527e5de-8572-446a-a57a-706f15467461",
      "created": "2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "modified": "2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "some_custom_stuff": 14,
      "other_custom_stuff": "hello"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------

=== 11.3 Custom Object Extensions (Deprecated)

_Custom Object Extensions *SHOULD* be defined using the STIX Extension mechanism for *property-extension* as described in <<_extension_definition>>._

In addition to the Predefined Cyber Observable Object extensions, STIX supports user-defined custom extensions for STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCO).
As with Predefined Object Extensions, custom extension data *MUST* be conveyed under the extensions property.
Note, custom extensions can only be used with SCOs.

==== Requirements (Deprecated)

* A SCO *MAY* have any number of Custom Extensions.
* Custom Extension names *MUST* be in ASCII and are limited to characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and hyphen (-).
* Custom Extension names *MUST* end with "-ext".
* Custom Extension names *SHOULD* start with "x-" followed by a source unique identifier (like a domain name), a hyphen and then the name. For example: [stixtype]#x-example-com-customextension#.
* Custom Extension names *MUST* have a minimum length of 3 ASCII characters.
* Custom Extension names *MUST* be no longer than 250 ASCII characters in length.
* Custom Extension names that are not prefixed with "x-" may be used in a future version of the specification for a different meaning. If compatibility with future versions of this specification is required, the "x-" prefix *MUST* be used.
* Custom Extensions *SHOULD* only be used when there is no existing extension defined by the STIX 2.1 specification that fulfills that need.
* A Custom Extension *MUST* have one or more properties.
* The name of a property of a Custom Object Extension *MUST* be in ASCII and *MUST* only contain the characters a-z (lowercase ASCII), 0-9, and underscore (_). The "x_" prefix as described in <<_requirements_deprecated>> *MAY* be used.

*Examples*

_Custom File object extension_
--------------------------------------
{
  "type": "file",
  "hashes": {
    "SHA-256": "effb46bba03f6c8aea5c653f9cf984f170dcdd3bbbe2ff6843c3e5da0e698766"
  },
  "extensions": {
    "x-example-com-foo": {
      "foo_val": "foo",
      "bar_val": "bar"
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------

Software supporting an optional feature *MUST* comply with the normative requirements of that feature.
* It *MUST* support JSON as a serialization format and *MAY* support serializations other than JSON.

=== STIX Object Mandatory Features

==== Versioning

A STIX 2.1 Producer or STIX 2.1 Consumer *MUST* support versioning by following the normative requirements listed in <<_versioning>>.

=== STIX Object Optional Features

==== Object-Level Data Markings

A STIX 2.1 Producer or STIX 2.1 Consumer *MAY* support "Object-Level Data Markings".
Software claiming to support "Object-Level Data Markings" *MUST* follow the normative requirements listed in <<_marking_definition>> and <<_object_markings>>.

==== Granular Data Markings

A STIX 2.1 Producer or STIX 2.1 Consumer *MAY* support "Granular Data Markings".
Software claiming to support "Granular Data Markings" *MUST* follow the normative requirements listed in <<_marking_definition>> and <<_granular_markings>>.

==== STIX Extensions

A STIX 2.1 Producer or STIX 2.1 Consumer *MAY* support STIX Extensions as defined in <<_extension_definition>>.
Software claiming to support STIX Extensions *MUST* follow the normative requirements defined in <<_extension_definition>>.

=== STIX Patterning Conformance

Implementers of the STIX Patterning language are not required to support the full capabilities provided by the language.
Rather, implementers are strongly encouraged to support as much of STIX Patterning as feasible, given the capabilities of their products, but only required to support the minimum conformance level (defined below) necessary for their particular use cases.
For example, the vendor of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that looks for malicious network traffic may only need to implement the Comparison Operators and support basic Observation Expressions to explicitly match against network traffic and IP addresses.

While the STIX Patterning language specification is tightly coupled with the STIX Cyber-observable Object data models, it is understood that in many (or even most) implementations STIX Patterns will be used as an abstraction layer for transcoding into other proprietary query formats.
STIX Patterns may be evaluated directly against a corpus of STIX Observed Data instances, but they may also, for example, be translated into some query syntax for a packet inspection device.
In this second case, the STIX Patterns are in fact evaluated in the context of data passing on the wire, not in the form of STIX Cyber Observables.

The STIX Patterning language's Observation Operators allow for the creation of patterns that explicitly match across multiple Observations; however, the language purposefully does not specify anything about the source of the underlying data for each Observation.
For example, depending on a particular patterning implementation, the data for a pattern that matches on network traffic could come from an endpoint or from a NIDS.
It is incumbent upon implementers to ascertain the appropriate data sources (where applicable) for each Observation within a given pattern.

=== STIX Pattern Producer

Software that creates STIX patterns is known as a "Pattern Producer".
Such software *MUST* support the creation of patterns that conform to all normative statements and formatting rules in this document.
Pattern Producers *MUST* specify their conformance in terms of the conformance levels defined in <<_stix_patterning_conformance_levels>>.

=== STIX Pattern Consumer

Software that consumes STIX patterns is known as a "Pattern Consumer".
Such software MUST support the consumption of patterns that conform to all normative statements and formatting rules in this document.
Pattern Consumers *MUST* specify their conformance in terms of the conformance levels defined in <<_stix_patterning_conformance_levels>>.

=== STIX Patterning Conformance Levels

==== Level 1: Basic Conformance

Software that conforms to the minimum required aspects of the patterning specification, is known as a "Level 1 STIX Patterning Implementation".

Such software *MUST* support the following features by conforming to all normative statements and behaviors in the referenced sections:

* Single Observation Expressions (omitting Qualifiers), as described in <<_observation_expressions>>
* All Comparison Operators, as described in <<_comparison_operators>>

This level of conformance is intended primarily for software that is deployed at endpoints or network boundaries and which is architecturally unable to maintain state, as would be required in order to support Qualifiers such as [stixliteral]#WITHIN#.

==== Level 2: Basic Conformance plus Observation Operators

Software that supports the minimum required aspects of the patterning specification but can operate on multiple Observations, is known as a "Level 2 STIX Patterning Implementation".

Such software *MUST* support the following features by conforming to all normative statements and behaviors in the referenced sections:

* Single and Compound Observation Expressions (omitting Qualifiers) as described in <<_observation_expressions>>
* The [stixliteral]#AND# Observation Operator, as described in <<_observation_operators>>
* The [stixliteral]#OR# Observation Operator, as described in <<_observation_operators>>
* All Comparison Operators, as described in <<_comparison_operators>>

This level of conformance is intended primarily for software such as HIDS that can detect patterns across separate Observations but may not support temporal-based patterning.

==== Level 3: Full Conformance

Software that is fully conformant with *all* of the capabilities of the patterning specification is known as a "Level 3 STIX Patterning Implementation".

Such software *MUST* support the following features by conforming to all normative statements and behaviors in the referenced sections:

* <<_definitions>>. Definitions
* <<_stix_patterns>>. STIX Patterns
* <<_pattern_expressions>>. Pattern Expressions
* <<_observation_expressions>>. Observation Expressions
* <<_comparison_expressions>>. Comparison Expressions
* <<_object_path_syntax>>. Object Path Syntax

This level of conformance is intended primarily for software such as SIEMs that support temporal-based patterning and can also aggregate and detect patterns across multiple and disparate sources of Observations.

[appendix]
== IANA Considerations

This appendix contains the required information to register the STIX media type with IANA.
While some of the information here is only for IANA, implementers of STIX should pay close attention to the security considerations and privacy considerations outlined in this appendix.

Guidance for using STIX in a way that maximizes its benefits and reduces its challenges can be found in the STIX Best Practices Guide <<BestPractices>>.

This document defines the `"application/stix+json"` media type.

Media type name: `application`

Media subtype name: `stix+json`

Required parameters: None

Optional parameters: version
[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|This parameter is used to designate the specification version of STIX that is being used during HTTP content negotiation. Example: `"application/stix+json;version=2.1"`. The parameter value is of the form 'n.m', where n is the major version and m the minor version, both unsigned integer values.
|===
Encoding considerations: binary
[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|Encoding considerations are identical to those specified for the `"application/json"` media type. See <<RFC8259>>.
|===

Security considerations:
[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|Security considerations relating to the generation and consumption of STIX messages are similar to `application/json` and are discussed in section 12 of <<RFC8259>>.

Unicode is used to represent text such as descriptions in the format.
The considerations documented by Unicode Technical Report #36: Unicode Security Considerations [<<UnicodeTR36>>] should be taken into account.

The STIX standard does not itself specify a transport mechanism for STIX documents.
It is expected that TAXII is often used (which uses TLS via HTTPS).
As there is no transport mechanism specified, it is up to the users of this to use an appropriately secured transport method.
For example, TLS, JSON Web Encryption <<RFC7516>> and/or JSON Web Signature <<RFC7515>> can provide such mechanisms.

Documents of `"application/stix+json"` are STIX based Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
The documents may contain active or executable content as well as URLs, IP addresses, and domain names that are known or suspected to be malicious.
Systems should thus take appropriate precautions before decoding any of this content, either for persistent storage or execution purposes.
Such precautions may include measures such as de-fanging, sandboxing, or other measures.
The samples included in STIX documents are reference samples only, and there is no provision or expectation in the specification that they will be loaded and/or executed.
There are provisions in the specification to encrypt these samples so that even if a tool decodes the data, a further active step must be done before the payload will be "live".
It is highly recommended that all active code be armored in this manner.

STIX specifies the use of hashing and encryption mechanisms for some data types.
A cryptography expert should be consulted when choosing which hashing or encryption algorithms to use to ensure that they do not have any security issues.

STIX provides a graph-based data model.
As such, STIX implementations should implement protections against graph queries that can potentially consume a significant amount of resources and prevent the implementation from functioning in a normal way.

This specification also describes "STIX Patterning", a mechanism to describe and evaluate a search/match for data observed on systems and networks.
Patterning is a grammar itself and includes PCRE regular expressions.
Care should be taken when parsing and evaluating the grammar (particularly when evaluating PCRE from unknown or untrusted sources) as they can potentially consume a significant amount of resources.

Care must be taken when parsing and using CTI with SCOs that use UUIDv5 IDs.
The recommended hash, SHA-1, is not cryptographically secure and does not guarantee that two SCOs are unique, e.g. two SCOs with contributing properties that are different and hashed per the recommended method, may have the same resulting UUIDv5.
As SCOs using UUIDv5 are not tied to a particular author via created_by_ref, traditional filtering on TAXII feeds may fail to ensure invalid, or colliding objects are not integrated, utilized or distributed.
|===

Privacy considerations:

[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|These considerations are, in part, derived from Section 10 of the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange <<RFC8322>>.

Documents may include highly confidential, personal (PII), and/or classified information.
There are methods in the standard for marking elements of the document such that the consumer knows of these limitations.
These markings may not always be used. For example, an out-of-band agreement may cover and restrict sharing. Just because a document is not marked as containing information that should not be shared does not mean that a document is free for sharing.
It may be the case that a legal agreement has been entered into between the parties sharing documents, and that each party understands and follows their obligations under that agreement as well as any applicable laws or regulations.

Adoption of the information-sharing approach described in this document will enable users to more easily perform correlations across separate, and potentially unrelated, cybersecurity information providers.
A client may succeed in assembling a data set that would not have been permitted within the context of the authorization policies of either provider when considered individually.
Thus, providers may face a risk of an attacker obtaining an access that constitutes an undetected separation of duties (SOD) violation.
It is important to note that this risk is not unique to this specification, and a similar potential for abuse exists with any other cybersecurity information-sharing protocol.
|===

Interoperability considerations:
[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|The STIX specification specifies the format of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof.
In addition, the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee has defined interoperability tests to ensure conforming products and solutions can exchange STIX documents.
|===

Published specification:

[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===

|STIX Version 2.1 OASIS Committee Specification 01 +

Applications which use this media:
[grid=none, frame=none,cols="2%,98%",width="100%"]
|===
|
|Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) such as Threat Actors, Campaigns, Intrusion Sets, Attack Patterns, Indicators of Compromise, etc.
STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.
STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.

Observed Data object: expanded description to broaden its usage, made "first_observed", "last_observed", and "number_observed" properties optional, added normative statements to "first_observed" and "last_observed" properties to address consistency between the properties.

Option object: renamed "description" property to "explanation".

Sighting object: updated normative text for the "where_sighted_refs" property to allow for using Location objects in addition to Identity objects.

Artifact object: updated normative text for "encryption_algorithm" from a SHOULD to a MUST use values from the defined enumeration.

Network Traffic object: added text to indicate that values for byte and packet counts are positive integers.
